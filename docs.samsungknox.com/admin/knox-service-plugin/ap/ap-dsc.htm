      Settings Customization
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Deep Settings Customization feature is available on devices running
      Knox v3.4 and higher with a KPE Premium license.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Create and configure deep settings</h2>
    <p>
      The following example describes the process to create and configure a new
      policy that hides all notifications on the screen when the device is
      locked.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In your UEM console, open the Device Configuration Profile that is
        associated with your target devices. On the middle navigation menu,
        click <b>Properties</b>. The Device Configuration Policy Properties page
        opens.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Properties page, in the <b>Settings</b> list, click
        <b>Configured</b>. The OEMConfig page for the Device Configuration
        Policy opens.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        On the OEMConfig page, next to Device and Settings customization profile, click <b>Configure</b>. The
        Device and Settings customization profile page opens.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the customization profile page, next to the Configure values in
        settings menu title, click <b>Configure</b>. The Configure values in
        settings menu page opens to show a refreshed navigation menu to its
        immediate left.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the refreshed navigation menu, click
        <b>Configure values in settings menu</b> &gt; <b>Add setting</b>. The
        Configure values in settings menu page opens to show fields and controls
        that help you customize your device settings.
      </li>
      <li>Do as follows:
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
        <li>
          In the <b>Name of the setting item</b> list, select
          <b>Lock screen &gt; Notifications &gt; Hide content</b>.
        </li>
        <li>In the <b>Set value for setting</b> list, select <b>On</b>.</li>
        <li>
          If you want to allow the device user to change this setting, in the
          <b>Allow end-user modification of this setting</b> field, click
          <b>True</b>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Click <b>OK</b>. The new setting is
        created and you can now deploy it to your target devices. For
        information, go to: <a href="ap-dsc.htm#deployDSC">Deploy deep settings</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="callout success">
      <b>NOTE</b>—Repeat steps 5 to 7</a> for each type of deep setting you
      want to configure in your Device Configuration Profile.
    </div>
     
    <h3>Side key</h3>
    <p>
      The side key used to be a single purpose power key, but on newer devices
      you can program the side key to perform multiple functions depending on
      how it is pressed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double press</li>
      <p>
        You can use this key to configure quick launch camera, open Bixby or
        open any app installed on the device. This can be done using
        <a href="ap-device-key-mapping.htm">Device key mapping.</a>
      </p>
      <li>Long press</li>
      <p>
        It can be used to wake Bixby or open the power off menu on long press.
        Wake Bixby is currently supported only in Work Profile on Corporate
        owned (WP-C) devices and will be grayed out in other modes. Power Off is
        currently supported in both Device Owner (DO) and WP-C modes.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Side Key press and hold can be configured in
      <b
        >Device and Settings customization profile &gt; Configure values in
        settings menu &gt; Configure a setting menu item.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="../../../assets/merge/images/ksp-side-key.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Configure the Side Key mapping as shown in the image. In
      <b>Specify value</b> field, IT admins can enter either 0 or 1. Set the
      value to 0 to wake Bixby and 1 to open the power off menu. Disable
      <b>Allow end-user modification of this setting</b> to disallow end-users
      to modify settings. The corresponding menu item on the UI is grayed out.
      Enable <b>Configure to hide settings</b> to hide this setting from the UI.
    </p>
    <div class="callout success">
      <b>NOTE</b>—To configure deep settings that require specific values be set
      beyond simply enabling or disabling a specific control, go to

    </div>
    <h2><a name="configUniqueDSC"></a>2. Configure unique deep settings</h2>
    <p>
      The following describes how to set specific deep settings that require
      configuration beyond simply enabling or disabling a specific control. This
      section will be periodically updated as unique deep settings requiring
      specific configuration values are added.
    </p>
    <div class="callout success">
      <b>NOTE</b>—For information on the unique configuration controls available
      to the device Lockscreen, go to:
      <a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-service-plugin/ap/ap/ap-lockscreen-customization.htm#DeepLockscreen">Deep settings for Lockscreen policies</a>. These deep
      settings include the configuration parameters required for the roaming
      clock, face widgets, notifications, language and input, system sounds and
      vibrations, display settings, and font utilization.
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Refer to the <b>Show notification icons</b> controls to define whether
        all or some notifications display on the device. Notification setting,
        (battery percentage, icon display, etc.) adjustments are made within the
        <a href="ap-lockscreen-customization.htm" target="_blank"
          >Lockscreen customization policies</a
        >
        section. Enter the notification icon display setting as one of the
        following numeric values:
        <ul>
          <li><b>0</b>— All notifications are received.</li>
          <li>
            <b>1</b>— Only the three most recent notifications are received.
          </li>
          <li><b>2</b>— Notifications are turned off and none are received.</li>
          <li>
            <b>3</b>— Notifications are enabled, but only a defined number are
            received.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set one of the following <b>Language Shortcut</b> values to configure
        how language shortcuts are utilized on the device. Language settings are
        configured within the
        <a href="ap-device-settings.htm">Device settings policies</a> section, while
        other language settings such as preferred speech engine, pitch and
        speech rate can be set within the
        <a href="ap-lockscreen-customization.htm#deepLockscreen" target="_blank"
          >Lockscreen customization policies</a

        numeric values:
        <ul>
          <li><b>1</b>— shift+space</li>
          <li><b>2</b>— ctrl+space</li>

    <h2><a name="deployDSC"></a>3. Deploy deep settings</h2>
    <p>
      The following example describes how to use the policy that hides all
      notifications on the locked device screen to automatically secure target
      devices in a group called High security devices.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        After you have created a deep settings policy in your chosen Device
        Configuration Policy, go to <b>Groups</b> &gt; <b>All groups</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within the <b>All groups</b> page, confirm the
        <b>High security devices</b> device group exists. Refer to your UEM
        console's help documentation for information on creating a new, or
        editing an existing, device group.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to the Device Configuration Policy that contains the appropriate deep
        settings configuration &gt; click <b>Assignments</b> &gt;
        <b>Include</b> tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Include page, in the Assign to list, select
        <b>High security devices</b> &gt; click <b>Save</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depending upon the settings chosen for deploying Device Configuration
        Policy changes, the new settings are deployed on the devices in the High
        security devices group.
