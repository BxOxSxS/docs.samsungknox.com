            <h1>New Features in the KC (KCS 1.32) Release â€” June 24th 2020</h1> 

            <h2>1. KC Super Admin API access permissions</h2>
            <p>This feature enables Samsung Admins to provide KC API access permissions to requesting tenants, and in doing so, creating a new workflow from the KC portal to the KAPI portal for IT admins. Once a Samsung Admin grants API access permission to a tenant, the tenant's primary admin must also have the permission enabled. Once the admin has permission, they can subsequently grant it to other admins supporting the same tenant.</p>

            <h2>2. Disable Wi-Fi blocking</h2>
            <p>This enhancement addresses customer requests to disable Wi-Fi network blocking on Knox Configure supported devices. Though Samsung devices have Wi-Fi network blocking enabled by default, some customers report AP connection and battery consumption issues that may not occur if there was an option to turn off Wi-Fi network blocking.</p>

            <p>To address this issue, an option to <strong>Disable Wi-Fi Network Blocking</strong> is now included with existing profile <strong>Advanced Wi-Fi settings</strong>. A maximum of 5 SSIDs can be defined and configured with this setting.</p>
            <p>Disable Wi-Fi Network Blocking is available on Knox 3.5 and above supported devices, and XCover Pro devices running Knox version 3.4.1 and above.</p>

            <h2>3. Third party device keyboard support</h2>
            <p>This enhancement addresses administrator requests to add a 3rd party keyboard on devices managed by Knox Configure. A maximum of 5 third party keyboards can be added using the new <strong>Add keyboards</strong> setting within the <strong>Device settings</strong> screen.</p>
            <p><img src="../../../assets/merge/images/knox-configure/360050835833/Device_settings_KC.png"/></p>
            <p>The appropriate keyboard application must also be installed on the device to be added successfully using Knox Configure.</p>
