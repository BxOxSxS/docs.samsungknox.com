            <h2>1. Un-assign device action added to Devices screen</h2>
            <p>To date, admins can assign devices from the Knox Configure <strong>Devices</strong> tab, but not un-assign devices.</p>
            <p>This has resulted in reported frustration from admins inquiring why is it you can assign profiles from the Device tab <strong>ACTION</strong> drop-down menu, but not un-assign them.</p>
            <p>To address this shortcoming, the Knox Configure console has been updated to include the un-assign action within the <strong>Device</strong> tab ACTION drop-down menu. Profiles can be unassigned from devices when the device is a Profile assigned, Error, Canceled by user, Configured, Failed to configure, or Updates pushed state. An <strong>Unassign</strong> <strong>profile</strong> screen prompts for confirmation as a safeguard before the profile is unassigned from the device.</p>
