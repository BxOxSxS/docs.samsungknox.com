                                            <p>A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. </p>
                                            <p>In the same way, Knox Capture acts as a middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to  build barcode scanning logic into your business app using an SDK (software development kit).</p>
                                            <p>So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox&#160;Capture. Once the IT admin has set the profile, they push it to end-user devices through their&#160;EMM. End users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.</p>
                                            <h3><a name="Does"></a>Does <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> work on only Samsung rugged devices?</h3>
                                            <p>Yes. <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> is designed to boost the productivity of a Samsung rugged device. See <a href="welcome.htm#Devices">Supported devices</a> for a list of devices that <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> currently supports. Additional rugged models will be added shortly.</p>
                                            <h3><a name="How12"></a>How do I know if this app is right for my organization?</h3>
                                            <p><span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> for business apps.</p>
                                            <h3><a name="How13"></a>How do I install <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span>?</h3>
                                            <p>Install <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> from the Google Play Store. To install <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> on multiple managed devices,  use Managed Google Play in the EMM console.

                                            <p>This means the device software (OS) is not supported, and should be upgraded to the latest version. This message may also appear if your wireless carrier has not pushed recent updates to the device.</p>
                                            <h3 id="faq-unsupported"><a name="Do2"></a>Do I need to restart the Knox Capture app when an admin pushes a policy update or a Knox Capture license?</h3>
                                            <p>Yes. If the Knox capture app is already launched by the user, then the app does have to be restarted.

                                            <p>Trigger the camera scanner, then tap the flashlight icon in the upper-left of the screen to turn the flashlight on or off.</p>

                                            <p>Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings.

                                            <p>Keep in mind, <span class="GeneralKnoxScanProductNameShort">Knox Capture</span> is disabled for Android system apps. This means scanning will not work for pre-installed apps like Calculator and Clock in the /system/app folder on a device.</p>

                                            <p>No. Preloaded system apps, such as Google Maps, are not supported by Knox Capture, except for the Chrome browser and the Samsung Messages app.</p>
                                            <h3><a name="Why2"></a>Why can a code with an out of length range still be scanned successfully?</h3>
                                            <p>For instance, when I set a symbol count range of 7-20 (min length 7 and max length 20) for code128, I noticed the following behavior:
</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li value="1">Code "1234567" (length 7) can be successfully scanned.
</li>
                                                <li value="2">	Code "12345678" (length 8) can be successfully scanned.
</li>
                                                <li value="3">Code "123456" (length 6) can NOT be successfully scanned.
</li>
                                                <li value="4">Code "12345" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. -&gt; unexpected!
</li>
                                                <li value="5">Code "1234" (length 4) can NOT be successfully scanned.
</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>There is a difference between the number of digits/characters, and the number of active symbol counts when setting the length. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard, for instance, code 128 differs from code 39. For code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single code 128 to achieve the shortest possible code.

                                            <h3><a name="Why4"></a>My devices are enrolled in WP-C mode. Why isn’t scanned data being sent to my browser or web app through keystroke output?</h3>
                                            <p>In <a href="../knox-platform-for-enterprise/device-management-modes.htm#wpc">WP-C</a>, a change was made to the way web apps (apps that load web pages internally instead of through the Android native UI) handle text view focus after scanning. In previous deployment modes, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required in WP-C.</p>
                                            <p>To handle this change, you must enable the <b>Allow remote control</b> policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view.</p>
                                            <div class="callout warning"><b>NOTE</b>—Enabling the <b>Allow remote control</b> policy is only required if you have activated a <a href="../../dev/common/knox-licenses.htm#:~:text=KPE%20Premium,-%E2%80%94Provides" target="_blank">KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license</a>.</div>
                                        
										<h3><a name="How12"></a>How do I prevent users from remapping the XCover key?</h3>
        <p>You can disable XCover key remapping from your EMM.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) section of your EMM.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Device-wide policies</b>, then set <b>Enable device policy controls </b>to <b>Enable</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Device Key Mapping (Premium)</b>, then configure the settings as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Set <b>Enable Key Mapping Controls</b> to <b>Enable</b>.</li>
                <li>Set <b>Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams</b> to <b>Disable</b>.</li>
                <li>Enter the <b>Package name</b> as <code>com.samsung.android.app.smartscan</code>.</li>
                <li>Enter the <b>Intent for Key press</b> as <code>com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS</code>.</li>
                <li>Enter the <b>Intent for Key release</b> as <code>com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
                <li>Then, set <b>Enable Key Mapping to Launch &amp; Exit applications </b>to <b>Disable</b>.</li>
                <li>Save and apply the policies to your device.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The XCover key can then no longer be remapped on the device, which you can verify in the device&rsquo;s settings &gt; <b>Advanced features</b>. When the key is pressed, the Knox Capture camera still launches as expected.</p>
