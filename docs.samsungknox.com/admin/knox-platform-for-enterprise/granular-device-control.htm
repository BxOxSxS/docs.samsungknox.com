    <body> <h1><MadCap:concept term="knox-platform-for-enterprise" />Granular Device Management </h1><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated – from surveying our customers – to help solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider on the market. Granular device policies help organizations save money, time, and administrative overhead. </p><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Read more conceptual information about <a href="../../whitepapers/knox-platform/granular-device-management.htm" target="_blank">Granular device Management in the Knox White paper</a>.</p><h2>Kiosk mode</h2><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Kiosk mode provides a variety of extended options to lock down or configure your device according to your business needs. Often it is used to create a single purpose device– for example, a point of sale kiosk. </p><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">The example below shows the settings required to lock a device to single app. The screen in the example below is available in Knox Manage AE Kiosk mode only. Once the package is uploaded, a variety of device restriction options are available. In this use-case, we have disabled all of the hardware buttons except the volume up and down. This prevents users from leaving the app or restarting the device.</p><p><img src="../../images/kpe-whitepaper/kiosk&#32;mode.png" />age AE&#160;</p><h2>Custom boot banner</h2><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Samsung Knox is the only device provider that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this is a mandatory security feature required to reach  compliance.</p><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">In this example below, a message to return the device to IT displays every time the device boots up.</p><p><img src="../../images/kpe-whitepaper/reboot&#32;banner.png" /></p><h2>Samsung DeX<br></br></h2><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Samsung DeX is a new user experience that extends the functionality of your Android device to a desktop environment. Simply connect a compatible device to an HDMI monitor with the Samsung DeX Station or DeX pad, and it automatically launches. Read more about <a href="../../whitepapers/knox-platform/dex-management.htm" target="_blank">DeX management in the Knox White Paper.</a></p><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Here is an illustration of this process when launched.</p><p><img src="../../images/kpe-whitepaper/dex-set-up.png" style="width: 849px;height: 439px;"></img></p><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Knox can control DeX features such as:</p><ul><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Enable/disable Samsung DeX Mode.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Set DeX mode screen time out configuration.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Allow/disallow screen time out change.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Enforce Ethernet only (block cellular data and Wi-Fi.)</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Check if a device is docked on the DeX station.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Disable certain application in DeX mode.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Add/Remove application shortcut in DeX mode home screen.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Change DeX loading screen.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Use Ethernet MAC address with device dependent.</li></ul><h2>Developer mode</h2><p MadCap:conditions="General.REVIEWED">Knox allows you to disable developer mode. This prevents access to settings on the phone that may be able to disrupt your MDM agent or policies (e.g - enable USB&#160;debugging). In this example below, we have turned off access to only a few of the developer mode features – background process limit, quit application upon killing activities and mock location. </p><p><img src="../../images/kpe-whitepaper/developer-mode-features.png" /></p><p>If developer mode is disabled, the user sees a prompt similar to this when they try to access it.</p><p><img src="../../images/kpe-whitepaper/developer-mode.png" style="width: 272px;height: 483px;" /></p></body>
