    <body> <h1><MadCap:concept term="knox-platform-for-enterprise" />Containers</h1><p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.WorkProfileLong" /> is a secure container that separates work apps and data from personal apps and data. Work profiles allow an IT department to securely manage a work environment without restricting users from using their device for personal apps and data. </p><p>Knox Platform for Enterprise is a superset of features built on top the Android Enterprise framework. On Samsung devices, a work profile is a hardware-based security solution built on the secure ARM TrustZone.&#160;Through Knox Platform for Enterprise, IT&#160;admins have additional, more granular controls over work profile on Samsung devices.</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>In an enterprise deployment, <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/terminology" target="_blank">Google provides three modes of Android Enterprise:</a></p><ul><li><b>work profile: </b>Helps admins manage the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) use-case, where a device user owns the device and uses it both personally and for work. A UEM&#160;app sits inside the work profile as the Profile Owner (PO), providing IT admins with control over the work profile only.</li><li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>fully managed device: </b>Helps&#160;admins manage company-owned devices that are used for work only. A UEM&#160;app runs as the Device Owner (DO) of the device, providing IT admins with full control over the device.</li><li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>fully managed device with work profile: </b>Helps&#160;admins manage company-owned devices that are used for both work and personal purposes. A UEM&#160;app runs as both a Device Owner as well as a Profile Owner, providing IT admins with full control over both.</li></ul><p>The apps and data inside a work profile are isolated from those outside the work profile. Specifically, apps outside the work profile can't use Android inter-process communication with apps inside the work profile. Data sharing is also limited. For example, photos taken with the camera inside the work profile are not viewable in the Gallery outside the work profile. The same restriction applies to copying and pasting. When allowed by an IT policy, some app data, such as contacts and calendar data, can be shared across the work profile boundary. The device user can choose whether to share contacts and calendar notes between the work profile and personal space. However, an IT policy ultimately controls this option.</p><p>An enterprise can manage the work profile like any other device feature, using a UEM&#160;system. The Knox Platform for Enterprise offers a large set of policies for authentication, data security, VPN, e-mail, blocking and allowing apps, and so on.</p><p>The following images show the device's home screen with the personal side (left) and the work profile home screen after the user has logged in (right). Apps inside the work profile are distinguished by a keyhole badge in the lower right corner of their launcher icons.</p><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/personal-mode-android-p.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-home-android-p.jpg" style="width: 241px;height: 493px;" /></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Use case</b></p><ul><li>A small start-up company supports a BYOD program, allowing employees to use their personal phones for work.</li><li>To isolate the apps managing confidential information, the company uses a Knox Workspace container on each personal phone.</li><li>The IT admin uses an MDM console to create a container, which has pre-installed email and browser apps already in the container for work.</li></ul><p><b>Benefits</b></p><ul><li>Prevention of apps intentionally or inadvertently accessing apps or data they are not authorized to.</li><li>Protection of private data, which is managed in a sand-boxed environment.</li><li>Easy separation of personal apps and business apps, which are in a Knox Workspace container.</li></ul><div class="callout success">For more information on Knox features, read the <a href="../whitepaper/kpe/samsung-knox.htm" target="_blank">Knox White Paper</a>.  </div><h2>Policy changes</h2><p>The following features are affected when you upgrade to a work&#160;profile in Knox 3.x.</p><table style="width: 100%;"><col style="width: 247px;" /><col /><tbody><tr class="blue"><td style="font-weight: bold;">Feature</td><td><b>Change</b></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Badges</td><td><p><b>Applicable to work profile only</b><![CDATA[  ]]></p><p>Upon Knox license activation, the work profile and app badge changes from a briefcase to a shield to indicate that the Knox license has been activated.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Password Enforcement</td><td><p><b>Applicable to work profile only</b></p><p>The Knox framework doesn't enforce passwords by default. IT admins can leverage either Android policies or Knox policies to apply password policies based on their enterprise requirements. </p><ul><li><b>Android password policy:</b> See your UEM console for more details. </li><li><b>Knox password policy:</b> See your UEM console for more details. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Default Policies</td><td><p>The Knox framework doesn't enforce stricter defaults for either the device or the configuration profile. The following features are enabled by default. IT admins can deploy Android or Knox policies to lock down the device or the configuration
				profile:</p><ul><li>USB Debugging</li><li>Screen Capture</li><li>Bluetooth</li><li>NFC</li><li>Copy and Paste from profile to device</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Default Apps</td><td><p>Android enables the following apps by default for the work profile. Knox doesn't enable additional apps by default for profile:</p><ul><li>Contacts</li><li>My Files</li><li>PlayStore</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Work Settings</td><td><p><b>Applicable to work profile only</b><![CDATA[  ]]></p><ul><li>In Android N, work profile settings are part of the device settings.</li><li>In Android O, work profile settings are available to the user as a separate app inside the profile.</li><li>In Android P, work profile settings are in the same menu as the device settings.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Screen Capture</td><td style="font-weight: normal;"><p>Prior to Knox license activation, work profile  screen shots are stored on the device side.</p><p>After a Knox License activation, screen shots are stored inside the work profile.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;text-align: left;">Keyboard and Input Methods</td><td style="font-weight: normal;text-align: left;"><p><b>Knox 3.2.1:</b> The Knox framework starting from Knox 3.2.1 separates personal and profile keyboards to ensure that important work data is not compromised. Admins do not have to allowlist IMEs any more.</p><p><b>Knox 3.0 - 3.2:</b>&#160;Only one IME is allowed for the entire device. Both device and profile have one IME. System IME is the default. However, IT admin can allowlist third  party IMEs as well.&#160;</p><p><b>Knox 2.9 and lower:</b>  (Legacy Knox Workspace CL and COM modes) Have one separate IME per user.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Approved Installers</td><td style="font-weight: normal;">By default, Google Play is the only approved installer. IT admins can allowlist other apps as installers as well. </td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Biometric Authentication</td><td style="font-weight: normal;">Management of biometric authentication (fingerprint and iris) are separate for Workspaces than the personal side. End user registers biometrics separately for profile. End user manages (add, remove and update) profile specific biometric data via work settings.
				</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Contacts and Calendar</td><td><p><b>Applicable to work profile only</b></p><p> <b>Android O and below:</b> The device user is able to search work contacts from personal side. The device user is also able to import and export work contacts and calendar. The IT admin can enable and disable contact search the import and export of work contacts and calendar. </p><p><b>Android P:</b> The device user is no longer  able to import and export work contacts and calendar.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Number of allowed containers </td><td><p>Only one B2B container and one personal container can be created on the device. Devices can have only one work profile and only one Secure Folder. Two work profiles are not allowed.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Policy Conflict</td><td><p>Now that a Device Owner and Profile Owner can call both Knox and Android policies on the same solution there are certain policies that will conflict. </p><ul><li><b>Exact Match polices :</b> Knox will eventually deprecate policies that are exactly the same as the Android counterpart. Our recommendation is to use Android policies.</li><li><b>Partial Match or Superset:</b> For policies that match partially or are superset of the other the recommendation, we do NOT recommenced to mix and match policies. You should either call Knox policies entirely OR Android policies
				entirely.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Policies moved to User Scope</td><td><p>Certain policies that are container scope (can only be called on the container) are moved to user scope. These policies can be called by the primary user (Device Owner) or the secondary user (Profile Owner).
	The policies are only applicable to the user that calls them.</p><p>For example, "enforce multi-factor authentication" was previously container scope (Knox 2.9) and is now user scope (Knox 3.2.1). Thus, the Device Owner can lock the device or enforce multi-factor authentication for the entire device with a single policy.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></body>
