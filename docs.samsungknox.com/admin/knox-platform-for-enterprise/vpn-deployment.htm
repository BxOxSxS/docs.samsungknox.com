        <p>Samsung Knox supports select Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions. This section describes how to use the Knox
        VPN client.</p>
        <h2>About Knox VPNs</h2>
        <p>Knox Platform for Enterprise supports these types of VPN models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Device-wide VPN* — </b>All outgoing traffic from the device goes through the same VPN connection. In this
            case, you use the Android VPN client that is preloaded with the device. This method is not recommended as it
            is not as secure as the next two methods. If you are using personal Knox this is the only VPN method
            available.</li>
            <li><b>Workspace wide VPN — </b>All data sent to and from the Knox container goes through the same VPN
            connection. With this model, you use a more powerful Knox VPN client, which supports a wider range of more
            secure VPN protocols.</li>
            <li><b>Per-app VPN — </b>You can configure up to 5 separate VPN connections and assign container apps to VPN
            connections. With this model, a container app can have its own dedicated VPN connection. You need the Knox
            VPN client for this model too.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As with other Workspace policies, IT Admins have the option to enable and set up these features to meet
        enterprise policies. You can use Workspace to manage VPN connections, but only for user accounts you control.
        This typically includes the default user and any Workspaces you activate. VPN connections for apps installed in
        user accounts you don't control, such as those created for Android for Work managed profiles, must be managed
        separately.</p>
        <h3>Knox Generic VPN framework</h3>
        <p>The Samsung Knox Virtual Private Network (VPN) framework enables advanced configurations using VPN clients from
        various vendors. Each client has unique features that can be researched to find the best match for your needs.
        Once you’ve selected a VPN client, you can download and deploy the client to your mobile devices, and can then
        use an MDM system to define and activate VPN profiles on devices.</p>
        <h3>Android VPN client</h3>
        <p>The built-in Android VPN client (also called StrongSwan) is available on all Samsung devices but, until now, has
        been limited to simple VPN configurations on individual devices. Samsung devices come with an enhanced version
        of the Android VPN Service. The built-in Android VPN client wasn’t designed to take advantage of these
        enhancements, limiting its use in enterprise environments. Modifying the client to support these enhancements
        would require us to maintain our own version of the client. This would require us to have our client separately
        certified for FIPS-compliance.</p>
        <h3>Android VPN Management for Knox</h3>
        <p>We chose to leave the Android VPN client unmodified and instead added a new management app to sit in between our
        enhanced VPN framework and the VPN client. This management app is called Android VPN Management for Knox and
        unlocks the following extra Knox VPN features for the built-in Android VPN client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">per-app connections</li>
            <li value="2">on-demand connections</li>
            <li value="3">device-wide connections</li>
            <li value="4">always-on connections</li>
            <li value="5">blocking routes to prevent data leakage if a mandatory VPN connection drops</li>
            <li value="6">MDM solutions can push VPN profiles to the built-in clients on multiple devices</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Samsung provides a VPN client. This tunnel is accessed through the normal VPN user interface and then selecting
        the appropriate options for the type of connection. To access the VPN interface:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">On the device, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Connections</strong> &gt; <strong>More
                Connections </strong>&gt;<strong> VPN</strong> &gt; <strong>Add VPN.</strong></li>
            <li value="2">Enter a name for this VPN connection.</li>
            <li value="3">Select the VPN type. The available types depend on the Android VPN client preloaded onto the
            device.</li>
            <li value="4">Enter the IP address of the VPN server.</li>
            <li value="5">Configure the VPN settings so that they match or are compatible with the VPN server settings.</li>
