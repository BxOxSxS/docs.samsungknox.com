To switch between the Workspace and personal side, simply tap the desired tab. This is shown in the screenshots below.</p><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/personal-mode-android-p.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-home-android-p.jpg" style="width: 241px;height: 493px;" /></p></div><!-- HEADER END --><!-- HEADER START --><h2>Workspace Settings</h2><p>Workspace settings have moved in Android P. They are now found under <b>Settings</b>&#160;&gt; <b>Workspace.</b></p><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-settings-menu.jpg" /><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-auto-lock.png" /></p><div class="container-full"><h2>Change unlock method
		</h2><p>Changing the Workspace unlock method allows you to choose between PIN, password, pattern or fingerprint authentication methods	&#160;You can disable certain unlock methods if desired through your MDM. In this case, the unlock options are greyed out. You can also require a strong password with a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and special symbols, or two-factor authentication. You can set up a biometric fingerprint password to access the secure Knox container, and select either a PIN, password, or pattern as the second authentication method.</p><p>To Change the Workspace unlock method on the device:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 18pt;" start="1"><li class="ListBullet">Open <b>Settings &gt; Workspace Settings &gt;Workspace lock type.</b></li><li class="ListBullet">Follow the on screen instructions to change your unlock method: PIN, password, pattern, or biometrics.	</li></ol><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-settings-menu.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-settings-android-p.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-lock-type-android-p.jpg" /></p></div><p><!-- HEADER END --></p><h2>Manage Apps</h2><p>There is no limit to the number of apps that can be installed or used in the container. The number of apps that can run within a container is only limited by the CPU and RAM of the device.&#160;When you install an app inside the container, it operates independently than the apps on the personal side. They do not share data, user accounts or settings.</p><h3>Install apps </h3><p>There are typically three ways to install an app into the Knox Workspace:</p><ul><li>Through an IT approved app store such as Google Play. Knox Workspace 3.0 and above has Google Play enabled by default.   If you don't see the Google Play icon inside the container, then you need to enable it with an MDM policy A IT policy with a supported MDM can enable or disable this.</li><li>An IT Admin pushes the app with a supported MDM console.</li><li>By copying apps from the personal space – an IT policy with a supported MDM can enable or disable this.</li></ul><p>NOTE –  Workspace does not allow users to side-load apps or download them from an internet browser.</p><h3>Delete apps </h3><p>You can delete apps from your Workspace if you are no longer using them. Deleting apps removes all data and personal settings from the app. Note that apps can: </p><ul><li>Deleted remotely with an IT policy. </li><li>Be set as 'non removable' with an IT policy. </li></ul><p>To delete apps from the Workspace on the device:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 18pt;" start="1"><li class="ListBullet">In the Workspace, long press the app you want to delete.</li><li class="ListBullet">Tap <b>Uninstall.</b></li></ol><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-delete.png" /></p><h2 class="">Manage data</h2><p>Knox Workspace utilizes the same physical memory as the personal space, but the memory blocks for the Knox Workspace container are logically isolated and secured.</p><p>However, there is no specific amount of memory or storage dedicated to Knox Workspace, and it’s not possible to set a maximum storage size either. The memory used by the Knox Workspace container dynamically changes based on the total and remaining device memory size and data size in the container.</p><p>Some data can be moved in and out of the Workspace.&#160;The types of data a device user can move is controlled by an IT policy.</p><p>To move data in and out of the Workspace: </p><ol><li>Highlight or check the desired file. </li><li>If the file can be moved, the following options are displayed: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Move to Workspace </span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Move to Personal Mode.</span></li></ol><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-move-contact-android-p.png" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-move-personal-android-p.jpg" /></p><h2>Workspace shortcuts in personal mode </h2><p>Direct shortcuts to apps in <span style="background-color: #ffffe0;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the Workspace can be added in your personal space.</span><![CDATA[  ]]></span>These direct shortcuts allow you to open a Workspace app without having to navigate to the Workspace tab/ None of the security benefits of the container are lost by using Workspace shortcuts in your personal mode. If a shortcut is created, it still prompts the device user for authentication before allowing access.</p><p>To ensure you are always using the secure Workspace version of an app in your personal space, look for the blue badge icon in the bottom right corner.</p><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/knox-badge-android-p.jpg" style="width: 92px;height: 103px;" /></p><p>To create a shortcut, </p><ol><li> Long press an app while in the Workspace</li><li>Select <b>Add to Home.</b></li></ol><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-add-to-home-android-p.jpg" /></p><p><!-- HEADER START --></p><h2 class=""><a name="2"></a>Change Workspace session timeout
		</h2><p>The Workspace session timeout is the length of time that must pass before the container locks itself and require re-authentication to access it's files. By default, the timeout is 10 minutes. If you don't do anything in the Workspace for this length of time, you to unlock the Workspace using your chosen unlock method. There are a few options to choose from: when the screen turns off, when the device restarts, or after 5, 10 or 30 minutes.</p><p>To change the Workspace session timeout on the device:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 18pt;" start="1"><li class="ListBullet">In the Workspace, tap <b>Workspace Settings.</b></li><li class="ListBullet">Tap <b>Auto lock Workspace</b></li><li class="ListBullet">Select the new timeout period.</li></ol><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-settings-menu.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-auto-lock.png" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-auto-lock-2.jpg" /></p><h2 MadCap:conditions="General.DRAFT">Change your Active Directory password inside Workspace         </h2><p MadCap:conditions="General.DRAFT"> Active directory passwords is a feature that allows you to log into your Workspace  using your Windows Active Directory credentials. These are typically the name and password that you use on your work computer. This requires Active Directory to be set up and the correct MDM policy to be applied.</p><ol><li MadCap:conditions="General.DRAFT">Tap <b>Enterprise Identity</b></li><li MadCap:conditions="General.DRAFT">Confirm your current AD password, tap <b>Next</b></li><li MadCap:conditions="General.DRAFT">Select <b>Enterprise Identity</b> as your unlock password.</li><li MadCap:conditions="General.DRAFT">Enter your new AD&#160;password.</li></ol><h2 class="">Modify            caller ID display information
		</h2><p>You can configure caller ID to display information about your Workspace contacts when in personal mode. By default, Workspace contacts information are displayed in the caller ID of the personal space when you receive an incoming call. </p><p>To modify the caller ID on the device. </p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 18pt;" start="1"><li class="ListBullet">In the Workspace, tap <b>Workspace Settings.</b></li><li>Tap <b>Notifications and Data.<br /></b></li><li style="font-weight: normal;">Turn <b>Show caller IDs</b> on or off.</li></ol><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-settings-menu.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-notifications-data.jpg" /></p><p>To modify the types of data shared between the personal side and Workspace, tap <b>Contacts and Calender. </b> Modify the settings to fit your needs. </p><p><img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-notifications-data.jpg" /> <img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/workspace-contacts-sharing.jpg" /></p><h2>Chamber </h2><p>Chamber is a folder inside the Workspace that is secured with defense-grade <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-prKfjfPUAhUIw4MKHQ74AHIQtwIIKzAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgBYXbspikFI&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6g1QWnHvlkOXy-hXZFzKyQW3CGg" target="_blank">Sensitive Data Protection (SDP)</a> technology.
