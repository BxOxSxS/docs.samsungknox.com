For more information about Cloud Connector, see <a href="overview-cloud-connector.htm">Using Cloud Connector</a>.</div>
      <ol>  <li>Add a directory server for accessing intra-enterprise data on the AD server. For more information about entering information in detail, see <a href="add-a-directory-server.htm">Adding a directory server</a>.<br />
