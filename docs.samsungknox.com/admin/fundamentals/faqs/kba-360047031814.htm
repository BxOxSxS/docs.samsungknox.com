        <div class="callout primary">
            <h2>Environment </h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Knox Cloud Services (KCS)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Overview </h2>
            <p>When inviting an administrator to a KCS solution, the following error is shown:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint" xml:space="preserve">[user email] has already been invited by a different customer. Please ask the user to contact Samsung Knox Customer Support if this is an error.</pre>
            <h2>Cause</h2>
            <p>An email can only be invited as an administrator to a Knox Cloud Services (KCS) once, and can only be associated with one company account.</p>
            <h2>Resolution</h2>
            <p>In your KCS solution's console, on the <b>Administrators &amp; roles </b>page, check that the user has not already been invited to the company. </p>
            <div class="note"><b>NOTE—</b>If you have signed up for multiple KCS solutions, please check the Administrators &amp; roles pages <b>of each service individually</b>.</p></div>
            <div class="note"><b>NOTE—</b>If you are using KME, on the <b>Administrators &amp; roles </b>page, ensure <b>Show blocked and revoked administrators </b>is selected.</p></div>
            <p>If the email invite shows as <b>Pending</b>, <b>Blocked</b> or<b> Revoked</b>, resend the invitation:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>In<b> Administrators &amp; roles</b>, select the invited user.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Edit administrator</b>.</li>
            <li>In <b>Edit Administrator</b>, select <b>Resend invitation</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the user's status is <b>Blocked</b> or <b>Revoked</b>, this should change the status to <b>Pending</b>. The status updates to <b>Active</b> when the user activates their account by following the invitation link sent to their email.</p>
            <p>If the user cannot be found in <b>Administrators &amp; roles</b>, please submit a ticket through your <a href="https://www.samsungknox.com/en">Knox dashboard</a>. Ensure you include the information below, along with any account access issues.</p>
            <p><i>The invited user's email</i></p>
            <p><i>The customer ID you are trying to add the user to</i></p>
