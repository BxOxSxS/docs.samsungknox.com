    <h1>MSP release notes — September 1st 2021</h1>
  <h2>MSP can manage Knox Manage service on MSP portal</h2>
    <p>Knox Manage (KM) is now included as one of the services available within Knox MSP Portal. This integration will be helpful for MSPs who want to manage multiple Knox Manage customers with Knox Suite licenses in one place.</p>
    <p>The following KM functionality is available within MSP:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Add new KM Customer</b> — MSP can add a new Knox Manage customer from within the MSP portal. When adding a new customer, the MSP need to provide all necessary and mandatory customer information such as general company information, organizational information for TenantID, and any other information needed to onboard the customer to Knox services. By default, when adding a new customer, the customer's access permissions are set to <b>No access</b>, meaning the customer cannot access the KCS portal and is fully managed by the MSP. The MSP can change this permission to <b>Full access</b>, meaning the customer can access the KCS portal and is jointly managed by the MSP.</li>
        <li><b>Invite existing KM Customer</b> — MSP can add an existing Knox Manage customer with Knox CustomerID to MSP portal, then MSP can manage the customer tenant that is already configured by the Admin of the customer company. MSP can provide customer access permission,that is <b>No access</b> and <b>Full access</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Manage KM services for managed customers</b> — After customer registration, MSP can manage customer’s Knox Manage Service. To access the KM portal, go to left hand navigation menu > <b>Customers</b> > <b>List of customers</b> > click <b>Active</b> to open the KM portal in a new browser tab.</li>
        <li><b>Update customer account</b> — During management, MSP can update customer information:
            <ul>
                <li>General company information, for example, Company address or phone number.</li>
                <li>Customers access permission, for example, No access permissions to Full access.</li>
                <li>Add additional Knox service for MSP’s management, for example, Add Knox E-FOTA. </li></ul></li>
        <li><b>Delink KM Customer</b> — If a customer and the MSP agree to terminate their contract, MSP can initiate the Delink process on MSP portal. Once the customer agrees to delink their account, then the customer is deleted from the MSP portal and MSP admins can no longer manage the customer’s account and services.</li>
        <li>Manage KM license and Knox Suite license
            <ul>
              <li><b>For fully managed customers</b>, MSP can

              <li>Check license information (Purchased/Used/Remaining Seats, Expiry date of license).</li>

          <ul><li>View KM license or Knox Suite license but all license actions will be done on customer KM portal.</li></ul></li>
          </ul>
    <h2>Knox E-FOTA service is available on the license menu of the MSP portal now</h2>
    <p>As Knox E-FOTA service is available on the license menu of the MSP portal now, MSPs can do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For fully managed customers, MSP can
        <ul>
          <li>Enter E-FOTA license or Knox Suite license and share it with multiple managed customers.
          <li>Issue a trial license and test license sharing
          <li>Check license information (Purchased/Used/Remaining Seats, Expiry date of license).
          <li>Replace E-FOTA license or Knox Suite license with another E-FOTA license or Knox Suite license.
          <li>Delete E-FOTA license or Knox Suite license.

            <li>View E-FOTA license or Knox Suite license but all license actions will be done on the customer E-FOTA portal.</li></ul></li></ul>
      <h2>Knox Configure license for fully managed customers can be replaced with other KC license on MSP portal</h2>
        <p>Knox Configure license management for fully managed customers is available already on the MSP portal except for the function of replacing a license, but is now available. So, if a customer assigned to a shared license wants to be delinked, the license can be replaced with a newly purchased license for the customer. Afterwards, that customer can be delinked.</p>
      <h2>Show/Hide menu title of the customer’s list view</h2>
        <p>Starting with this release, MSPs can manage all the titles of the show/hide section shown in the Customer list, with the exception of the customer name. Some MSPs may want to see a list of services, rather than the date the customer was added or modified. This new functionality allows the MSP to customize their view for ease of use.</p>
