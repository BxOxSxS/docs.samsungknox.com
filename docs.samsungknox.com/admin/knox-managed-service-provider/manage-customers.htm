        <p>If you want to stop managing a customer account, you can initiate a delink request from the MSP console. However, for the request to complete, the end customer must agree to the delink request and sign-up for KCS services if they haven't already done so. Until they accept the delink request, the MSP&#160;continues to manage their account. The MSP can revoke the request until customer takes an action.</p>
        <p>To initiate the request, sign in to your MSP portal and follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>

        <div class="callout warning"><b>NOTE—</b> When a delink request is initiated by the MSP, the customer status changes from <b>Active</b> to <b>Delink Requested</b>, and the customer gets a delink request email.

        <ul>
            <li>If the customer ignores the email, then the MSP continues to manage their services as usual but with their status as <b>Delink Requested</b> on the MSP portal.

            <li>In case of an existing customer, they log-in using their Knox Cloud Services credentials and take appropriate action as explained in the next section. In case of a new customer, in order to accept the delink request, the customer first needs to create a Knox cloud service account which is based on a Samsung account. They are guided through creating a new Samsung account and accepting agreements for the Knox solutions which the MSP manages for them. If they don’t wish to accept, they can ignore the request.</li>
            <li>After logging in, the customer is shown a pop-up to accept or reject the request.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>If they reject the request, then the MSP is informed and the status changes back to <b>Active</b>.</li><li>If they accept it, an email is sent to both parties.
