        <h2>Knox E-FOTA One</h2>
        <h3>Group hierarchy information for devices synced from SOTI </h3>
        <p>In SOTI, device groups can be arranged in hierarchies. That is, a device can belong to a group, and that group can in turn have a parent group. Previously, when adding a device from SOTI to Knox E-FOTA One, the IT admin only received information about the device group that device directly belonged to. Starting this release, the Knox E-FOTA One admin portal shows the hierarchical path of the devices so that IT admins can determine the hierarchical order of those devices in SOTI.</p>
        <p>Each device’s full hierarchical path is shown in the Path field when they do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">	Add or update the devices groups from SOTI (Update device groups on E-FOTA screen)</li>
            <li value="2">	Visit the EMM groups tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Support for multi-CSC devices </h3>
        <p>To aid IT admins in selecting the firmware versions that are appropriate for their devices, the CSC (Consumer Software Customization) info of each device is now available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">	When viewing devices in the <b>Devices</b> tab, the IT admin can customize the table columns to include each device’s CSC. When the IT admin exports the device list to a CSV file, the CSC info is also included.</li>
            <li value="2">	When viewing a device’s <b>Device details</b>, the IT admin can now see that device’s CSC.</li>
            <li value="3">	When assigning target devices to a <a href="../create-campaign.htm">campaign</a>, the IT admin fills in the <b>Assign Devices and Firmware</b> table in the campaign creation screen. Each row of that table represents a device group (a model/sales-code pair). The CSC of each device group is now pre-populated next to the sales code.  For device groups that have multiple possible CSCs, a dropdown-menu is displayed instead, so that the IT admin can select the CSC for that group.<img src="https://docs.samsungknox.com/assets/merge/images/efota/kcs_137_6.png" /></li>
            <li value="4">When the IT admin moves on to select target firmware for a device group, they only see target firmware versions that are compatible with that device group given its model, sales code, and CSC.</li>
            <li value="5">When creating, editing, and viewing a campaign, the IT admin can now see the CSCs of devices in that campaign.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improved error pages </h3>
        <p>The following error pages were modified to provide more guidance to users:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>404 error page</li>
        <li>500 error page</li>
         <li>503 error page</li></ul>
        <h3>Client agent version in exported device info </h3>
        <p>When an IT admin downloads the device list as a CSV file, the CSV file will now contain the version of the Knox E-FOTA One app installed on each device. This allows the IT admin to get a better insight into the status of their devices.</p>
        <h3>Deploying a firmware version based on a device’s current firmware type </h3>
        <p>This release note applies only to enterprises that purchased the Software Customization Services license and have custom firmware registered in Knox E-FOTA One.</p>
        <p>When the IT admin creates a campaign and selects firmware to deploy, the system behaves as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td style="font-weight: bold;">
                        <p>If</p>
                    </td>
                    <td style="font-weight: bold;">
                        <p>Then</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>The IT admin selects <b>Latest
 firmware</b> for a particular group of devices*.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>The latest firmware target is automatically defined as B2C or custom,
 depending on the current firmware type of that group of devices.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>The IT admin selects <b>Select
 from firmware list</b> for a particular group of devices*, and a custom firmware version is currently
 installed on that group.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>In the <b>Select the target
 firmware</b> screen that displays, only the <b>Custom firmware</b> tab is shown. This option prevents the IT admin from
 erroneously selecting normal firmware.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>The IT admin selects <b>Select
 from firmware list</b> for a particular group of devices*, and a normal firmware version is currently
 installed on that group.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>In the <b>Select the target
 firmware</b> screen that displays, only normal firmware versions are shown.
 This option prevents the IT admin from erroneously selecting custom firmware.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>* A group of devices is defined as a combination of model, sales code, and CSC. It refers to a row in the <b>Assign Devices and Firmware</b> table shown in the campaign creation screen.</p>
        <h3>Forcing a client refresh</h3>
        <p>IT admins can now push a client refresh to devices they select in the Devices tab. In the Actions menu, Force client refresh has been added. This new menu item is only enabled if all selected devices have the client app installed.</p>
        <p>When an IT admin selects this option, the following operations are performed:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The current campaign info is deleted.</li>
        <li>The Knox E-FOTA One app is updated to the latest version.</li>
        <li>The latest campaign info is synced, and the campaign is restarted.</li></ol>
        <p>This operation is recorded in the device log and the Activity Log.</p>
        <div class="callout note"><b>NOTE</b>—Items to consider:
        <ol>
        <li>This feature only works on devices with client version 1.1.16 or later.</li>
        <li>A push notification may take a maximum of 2 weeks, according to Google’s notification policy.</li>
