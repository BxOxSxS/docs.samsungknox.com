        <h1>With FOTA, can you skip a firmware version and upgrade to the subsequent version?</h1>
        <p>This would depend on the Samsung FOTA (B2C) server's policy for going to one version to another.</p>
        <p>For example, let's say you wanted to upgrade from device firmware version A to C and skip version B. There are two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update directly: If the FOTA server allows a direct update from version A to C, then only one firmware update is needed.</li>
            <li>Intermediary update needed: If the FOTA server requires that version B be installed first, then two firmware updates are needed, from A to B, then from B to C, with a device reboot in between.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that even if you set the firmware version only once, the firmware version can be updated more than once.</p>
