        <h1>What if a firmware update is performed on a device that has a higher firmware version than the update?</h1>
        <p>Samsung Knox E-FOTA does not support firmware downgrades. If you use Knox E-FOTA to perform a forced update on a device that has a newer firmware version than that of the update, the device's firmware is not updated.</p>
        <p>In some scenarios, a device might go into an abnormal state. If this happens, you can try the following: Let's say you forced a firmware update from version A to version B, but a device already had a later version C. If the device with version C gets into an abnormal state, force a firmware update on that device to version C.</p>
        <p>One way to avoid scenarios like this is to query the firmware version on a device (using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION">Android Build.VERSION</a>) first, and make sure that the device does not have a later version before you force an update on the device.</p>
