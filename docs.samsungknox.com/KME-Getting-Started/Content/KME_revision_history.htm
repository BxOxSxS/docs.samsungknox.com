                                    <h3>Allow role deletion for admin states</h3>
                                    <p>This feature addresses IT admin requests to delete a Knox Mobile Enrollment admin role with a pending, 
revoked or blocked state (any state but active). Prior to the role deletion, a message displays the 
intended admins impacted by the role deletion. 
 
</p>
                                    <p>Existing administrators assigned to the target role must be re-assigned to another role before the 
deletion can proceed.  Any pending, revoked, or blocked admins that were assigned the deleted role are 
assigned a role of NoRole.  </p>
                                    <h3>Display non-randomized Wi-Fi MAC address</h3>
                                    <p>This enhancement addresses KME customer requests to whitelist a device Wi-Fi address and have MPTS 
return the device's non-randomized Wi-Fi MAC address (the mobile device MAC) so it can be stored in the 
database and displayed via the KME portal using a properly formatted CSV file. </p>

                                    <p>This enhancement addresses admin requests for QR code enrollment (with Wi-Fi JSON data) using 
the device’s non-randomized MAC address, so the device can enroll more securely. 
Such customers need to whitelist device IMEIs to connect to their Wi-Fi network while enrolling. 
The MAC address is available via MPTS, but the device also needs to automatically use the 
MAC address when connecting to Wi-Fi. </p>
                                    <p>To support this request, a new checkbox option has been added within the <b>Add QR code</b> and <b>QR code for this profile</b>  screens to include the device’s MAC address within QR code’s Wi-Fi configuration data. The MAC address will now also display within the device details pop-screen as an additional device MAC address reference point.</p>
                                    <h3>Added QR code icon to profile table</h3>
                                    <p>To date, there is no ideal way to launch and review QR code details from the existing MDM Profiles screen. 
This resulted in reported confusion regarding which listed profiles contain a QR code.

</p>
                                    <p>To resolve this issue, a QR code icon now displays directly to the right of those profiles names 
that have a QR code configuration defined. 
</p>
                                    <p>Selecting the icon displays the QR code for this profile screen, where the QR code configuration 
can be reviewed and potentially modified. Additionally, the user is able to download and print the QR code as needed.</p>
                                    <h3>Console search hints added to reduce uncertainty</h3>
                                    <p>To date, there is no way to clearly know which fields within the KME console are searchable for specific parameters within any given screen, resulting in reported uncertainty as to what data can be included in console screen searches. </p>
                                    <p>
To remedy this uncertainty, the Search field is now longer to optimize free space within the console and include more search string data. Going forward, the following search string hints display within each listed screen:
</p>
                                    <ul>

                                    <p>To date, Knox does not support a Japanese reseller’s use of Google ZT's common library (CreateCustomer API) to onboard customers into an EMM. 

</p>
                                    <p>To address this issue, this KME release provides the following:

                                    <h3>QR code gesture enrollment</h3>
                                    <p>This release introduces QR code gesture enrollment as a fourth device-side enrollment option for Android 10 devices in addition to existing Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi Direct options A QR code is a unique matrix style barcode containing information about its attached item. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="Resources/Images/profiles_do_settings_add_qr_code.png" />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The QR code enrollment process begins with a device plus-sign (+)&#160;gesture that activates the device's camera in QR code recognition mode. Once a QR code is recognized, a Wi-Fi connection is made and enrollment begins. If there are no Wi-Fi credentials within the QR code, then the device user is prompted to provide them, as these are the Wi-Fi credentials used during device enrollment in Device Owner (DO) mode. The QR code profile configuration is initiated within the KME console's <b>Device Owner profile settings</b> screen by selecting the <b>ADD QR CODE</b> button. </p>
                                    <p>By default, the QR code is only used form devices uploaded by resellers. However, there is an option for other non reseller uploads as well. Consider non-reseller uploads to reduce the dependency of reseller involvement and the use of the <i>Knox Deployment App</i> (KDA). </p>
                                    <p>If adding a Wi-Fi- network configuration to the QR code, define the security option as either None, WEP, or WPA/WPA2. The QR code contains the profile ID, country, and an optional Wi-Fi SSID and password, all in a non-encrypted JASON format. Therefore, QR codes should only be shared with trusted devices. </p>
                                    <p>Once all the mandatory fields are populated, select <b>ADD</b> to include the QR code with the profile. The QR code is generated once the profile is created. </p>
                                    <p>QR code enrollment is supported on Android 10 devices only. For more information on using a QR code as a Knox Deployment App (KDA) enrollment option, go to <a href="about-kda.htm">Knox Deployment App</a>.

                                    <h3>Enhanced auto-assignment capability</h3>
                                    <p>This feature addresses customer requests to have multiple auto-assignment rules per reseller, rather than the single one currently available. This is done by the customer creating a profile alias which is shared with the reseller and can be used by the reseller when uploading devices. Once created, the reseller can attach the profile alias to an upload which the customer in turn uses for a profile auto-assignment rule. However, the reseller must be sure which alias to use per upload, so this feature should only be used when a reseller has coordinated with the customer regarding which profile alias to use.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="Resources/Images/kme_profile_alias.png" />
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
Profile aliases are not shared across resellers, so they are not unique across resellers but unique per reseller. 
There can be up to 10 profile aliases per reseller, but a profile alias can only be associated with a single profile. 
Try to keep the alias somewhat simple and easy to remember. Profile aliases are not required, and it is up to the reseller to optionally use. 
However, when created, an alias must be associated with an existing profile. </p>
                                    <p>Devices are auto-assigned the profile selected by the reseller via the associated profile alias. 
If a reseller decides to not use a profile alias, then the uploaded devices will be assigned to the default profile 
(if one exists) or be unassigned (if no default profile has been created for the reseller).</p>
                                    <p>A profile alias displays as a tag within the KME console and cannot be removed unless the device is deleted, 
assigned another profile, or the profile is removed. The <b>Device details</b> screen also displays an alias as a tag and whether 
the profile has been auto-assigned. Existing profile auto-assignment rules will not be changed, but additional rules can be added via profile aliases.</p>
                                    <h3>Blocked or revoked admins no longer display by default</h3>
                                    <p>KME admins do not always want to see blocked or revoked admins within the <b>Administrators &amp; Roles</b> screen. However, blocked (deactivated) and revoked admins are currently always displayed by default, with no way to filter them out of the display. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="Resources/Images/kme_blocked_admins.png" /> </p>
                                    <p>To remedy this issue, blocked and revoked admins no longer display by default within the Administrators &amp; Roles screen. Blocked and revoked admins can be displayed at any time by enabling the <b>Show blocked and revoked administrators</b> checkbox. The checkbox setting is persistent when logging in and out of the KME console. </p>
                                    <h3>Copyright notice added to emails</h3>
                                    <p>In response to a recent legal review, email sent from either the KME or the KME Samsung Admin servers need to have better copyright information. </p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>Beginning with this release, the footer of any email generated from either KME or the KME Samsung Admin server now has a copyright notice appended to the footer. </p>

                                    <h3>Dynamic APK URL link based on Google Managed Play</h3>
                                    <p>Admins have requested an easier and more reliable way to retrieve a MDM APK for DO profile utilization, rather than having to manually 
navigate to the APK, then enter the correct path to its location.
With this release, MDMs with APKs available at Google Managed Play can be selected, 
and their URLs populated dynamically. If <b>Other</b> is selected from the MDM drop-down menu the APK field remains editable.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="Resources/Images/apk_validation.png" />

                                    <p>When a supported DO is selected, a URL text box displays with the correct MDM APK URL, 
and a green checkmark lets the admin know the APK validation is successful. 
Alternatively, an error message displays if the selected MDM’s APK URL could not be parsed. Only tested and functional MDM APKs are available for selection. For more information on creating a KME DO profile supporting a particular MDM, go to: <a href="create-profiles.htm">create profiles</a>.</p>

Before the role can be deleted, a <b>Delete role</b> screen lists the role’s current administrator assignments. 
The deletion is not allowed if there are active users assigned to the role. These users must be assigned a different role to permit the deletion.

                                    <p>This enhancement addresses admin requests for a secure means to pass user-credentials during a device assignment API call. With this release, the Samsung Knox team provides a means for customers to encrypt user-credentials (username and password) before they are passed in an Assign Profile API call. The user credentials are then decrypted for device enrollment.

                                    <p>To date, when an admin cannot delete a reseller due to the reseller’s associated devices the <b>Delete</b> button is 
disabled, and the admin could be wondering why the delete function is inoperable. </p>

                                    <p>To remedy this situation, a tooltip now displays when hovering over the <b>Delete</b> button. 
The tooltip clearly states the reseller cannot be removed as long as it’s associated with devices utilized by a Knox Cloud Service.</p>

                                    <p>The KME survey was designed by the Knox team to better understand what users require from the KME service.</p>
                                    <p>Beginning with this release, users will be notified of the survey's availability. The questions are designed to gauge customer needs in respect to company size and deployment requirements. </p>

                                    <p>To better align with KC, and reduce the upfront enrollment complexity for new customers, a new get started carousel and auto tour have been

                                    <p>With this release, the activity log has been enhanced to provide a broader range of administrator role event changes.  
These administration and role events included in the activity log include, administrator invitations, administrator logins, 
administrator modifications, resent/reactivated/revoked invitations, blocked administrators, added and modified roles, and deleted roles.</p>
                                    <h3>Migrate existing profiles to either a DA or DO specific profile screen</h3>
                                    <p>KME profile creation has become more complex as new DO options (partner drop-down, Knox License, etc.) have been introduced. 
As DO options have become are increasingly different from DA options including them both in a single UX flow become unnecessarily cumbersome.
</p>
                                    <p>To resolve this issue, an admin can now specify whether they want to uniquely configure a <i>Device Owner</i> (DO) or 
<i>Device Admin</i> (DA) supported profile. Once selected, the subsequent screen flow navigation is specific to either the DO or DA profile type selected. </p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>This enhancement will allow admins to configure a required profile with greater efficiency with no confusion on whether any configuration 
items are required to their intended DO or DA profile.</p>
                                    <h3>View only administrative permission added</h3>
                                    <p>This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator view only permissions. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. 
</p>
                                    <p>When a View only radio button is not selected, all nested options under that category (Profiles, Resellers etc.) are disabled. Additionally, if a radio button has nested options and that category has View only selected, at least one of its permission checkboxes must also be selected. 
New roles have View only enabled by default. Existing roles that inherit the new View only permission have it turned off by default to prevent issues. 
</p>
                                    <p>For KME, Manage tags and Manage device users have also been added as additional permissions.

                                    <p>To date, an admin is unable to invite another admin belonging to a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or an admin with Admins' permissions can now invite an admin belonging to a different service to a role in their service. </p>

                                    <p>This feature addresses IT admin requests to only use the Knox Deployment App (KDA) for device enrollment, and not access any of the KCS portal resources (including the KME console). When relying exclusively on the KDA without the KME console, an admin must login into the KDA, choose a service (KC, KME, KG, etc.), select a profile, pair the master/admin device with the target device, and assign the profile to the master device. </p>

                                    <p>To avoid the further escalation of Knox Mobile Enrollment administrative roles and permissions issues, an existing admin who does not have a Manage roles permission requires additional restrictions for the roles they can assign to other administrators.</p>
                                    <p>With this release, existing administrators without a Manage role permission can only invite admins with a matching set of their own role permissions. As a result, the Invite administrator screen’s Role drop-down menu choices have been customized for the particular role of the admin creating the invitation.</p>
                                    <h3>View only administrator permission added</h3>
                                    <p>This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator View only permissions. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device, or reseller administration is permitted, just View only access.</p>

                                    <p>This release introduces a new enrollment option in addition to the existing KDA Bluetooth and NFC options. Wi-Fi direct supported devices can connect directly to one another via a WLAN without joining a traditional wireless network or Wi-Fi® hotspot. Once enabled, the device automatically scans for other supported Wi-Fi direct devices. Once discovered, specific devices can be selected for enrollment data transfers. 
 
</p>
                                    <p>With Wi-Fi direct, only out-of box trigger deployments are supported. Trigger deployments utilize a plus sign (+) gesture on a device's Welcome screen to start an out-of-box deployment and bypass the setup wizard.
</p>
                                    <p>


To utilize the Wi-Fi direct option, the receiver device must be utilizing Knox version 3.2 or above. Additionally, only Note9 and Tab S4 and above devices are supported. Wi-Fi direct is not supported on wearable devices.
</p>
                                    <h3>	Profile  UI updated to accommodate DO changes</h3>
                                    <p>To accommodate DO enhancements within KME, several console changes are required in respect to how Customer Support information is managed. Beginning with this release, when a profile created and customer support info added, a pop-up indicates the emulator display is for instances when DO is not selected, but the display will be different if the Enable this app as a Google Device Owner option is selected.  
</p>
                                    <p>Currently, if a DO enabled profile is created, only the Customer name displays within the Add profile details screen and descriptive text disappears, potentially confusing customers. To remedy this situation, helpful information remains displayed to reduce uncertainty when proceeding with the DO profile configuration.
</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, when a DO supported profile is created and the profile’s Customer Support Info is edited, only the customer name is editable. Remaining support information (address, email, phone) is greyed out, and descriptive text displays explaining these greyed out parameters are not supported with a DO profile. 
</p>
                                    <h3>	Bulk profile clear option now available</h3>
                                    <p>To date, admins have been unable to bulk clear profiles from their list of uploaded devices. To address this shortcoming, a <b>Clear profile</b> option has been added to existing bulk profile operations within the KME console.</p>

                                    <h2><a name="March2"></a>March 3rd 2019 KME feature updates</h2>
                                    <h3>Role-based access control (RBAC) improvements</h3>
                                    <p>This release introduces a new <i>Role Based Access Control</i> (RBAC) capability that allows customer (tenant) admins who are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate.  Though KME  utilizes admin roles unique to that service, a Super Admin cuts across all supported Knox Cloud Services. 
</p>
                                    <p>With the new RBAC service, existing KME&#160;customers will have their administrators migrated automatically with this March 2019 release. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service.
</p>
                                    <p>The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available.
</p>
                                    <h3>Different customer support information now available for each profile</h3>
                                    <p>To date, tenants can only use a single set of customer support information, regardless of the need to provide different support information to different profiles and users. Consequently, each end-user sees the same support content, even though the new KCS Customer API now supports different customer support information per profile.
</p>
                                    <p>With this release, when a profile is initially created an Admin is now prompted to input support contact information that can either be used across all profiles by default or just used with this one new profile. Existing customers can also be migrated to current Customer Support Info that then becomes the Default support information accessed in the top right hand menu.  Additionally, an admin can edit the contact information within just that individual profile. The admin can also edit the Default support information to have it available to new profiles upon creation, with no update made to existing profiles.
</p>
                                    <h3>KG +&#160;KME on the same device - soft deletion support</h3>
                                    <p>This feature introduces a new device deletion concept when KME is utilized with Knox Guard. If a device is only used with KME, its removal is a typical hard deletion and the device is removed from both KME and the Reseller Portal. </p>
                                    <p>However, if a device is used with both KME and Knox Guard, its deleted from KME only (soft deletion) and remains within the Knox Guard console. </p>

                                    <p>The central update is the introduction of a collapsible left-hand navigation menu, replacing the previous horizontal menu bar. This provides a visual-hierarchy of key enrollment and configuration console activities and administrator “call-to-actions.” 
</p>
                                    <p>The new KME console is personalized, with improved status updates from each user’s previous login. Colorized status indicators optimally display “at-a-glance” event severity to administrate with best in class efficiency.

                                    <h3><a name="New2"></a>New deployment trigger</h3>
                                    <p>A new device trigger was introduced in Knox 3.2 to streamline an enterprise device deployment when using Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) or Knox Configure (KC) with Galaxy Note 9 and Tab S4 devices. The new deployment trigger allows an out-of-the-box (OOB) device to be deployed (enrolled/configured) without first being uploaded by a reseller, and without the user invoking the setup wizard. 
</p>
                                    <p>To date, an out-of-box device that was not first uploaded by a reseller could only be deployed using the Knox Deployment App (KDA) running on a master device, but the user would first have to navigate through the setup wizard. With this release, a simple plus sign (+) gesture on the target device’s Welcome screen starts the out-of-box deployment directly, bypassing the setup wizard and saving time. The target device needs to be first connected to the master device running KDA via NFC or Bluetooth.  To further simplify things, Wi-Fi credentials can optionally be passed from the master device to the target device.
</p>
                                    <h3><a name="Customiz2"></a>Customizable screen column display</h3>
                                    <p>The columns within the <b>All Devices</b> screen can be filtered to display some or all nine of the columns available. Use the <b>Customizable Table</b> drop-down menu, invoked on the right-hand side of the column display, to de-select those columns you would like removed from the display.</p>
                                    <p>Use the filter options to select just those needed column values and select <b>Save Changes</b>. Once saved, the updated display settings are committed locally, and available in subsequent logins as long as the local system's cache is not refreshed.</p>

                                    <h3><a name="KME+DO"></a>KME+DO with KC support added </h3>
                                    <p>KME added support for Android Enterprise managed device mode in Knox 2.8 (on S8 and higher device platforms). Additionally, Samsung has now completed work for supporting KC + KME + Android Enterprise Managed device mode to increase opportunities for KC. KC can be launched from a KME enrolled device, by either selecting the device’s back key, or from a displayed device notification.</p>
                                    <p>When using KME with Knox Configure, be careful when unchecking the <b>Leave all system apps enabled</b> checkbox, as this may lead to conflicts with Knox Configure. For example, when setting the Samsung browser homepage, the Knox Configure policy will fail [51010] if system apps are disabled (since system apps include the Samsung browser).</p>

                                    <p>The characters highlighted in red above are new JSON attributes IBM wants to include with their DO support. IBM are using a two-letter key/value with a 500 JSON string character limit.
