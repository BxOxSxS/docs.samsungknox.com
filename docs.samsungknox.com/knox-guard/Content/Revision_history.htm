                                <h3>Customers using KG can now use other services in KCS</h3>
                                <p>Currently, customers using Knox Guard (KG) can use Knox Configure (KC) and Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) only after internal policy changes. Starting this release, customers using KG can additionally register to use other KCS services, such as KC, KME, KAI, and KM. This availability comes with the following improvements:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Register to use one or more of KCS services—Customers who want to use additional KCS services can follow a registration process to gain access to all of these services.</li>
                                    <li value="2">Information synced across all services—Once customers complete the registration process to access all KCS services, device information in KG is synced across all KCS services.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2>March 24th 2021 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>Set allow-list for Incoming call on lock screen</h3>
                                <p>There is a new option to configure an allow-list for incoming calls for locked devices.</p>

                                <p>This feature allows end users to receive incoming calls from allow-listed numbers even if the device is locked (Customers can add their Customer Support numbers to the allow-list and give guidance/request overdue payment when the device is locked).</p>
                                <h3>Per-device auto-lock</h3>
                                <p>Currently, the auto-lock option is applied by the tenant meaning all devices registered to a given tenant get locked once this option is enabled. For Knox Guard 1.38, auto-lock can be applied to certain devices in the case where the device is missing/stolen.</p>
                                <p>It is not required to Enable auto-lock again for devices that already have auto-lock applied (the device will continue to have auto-lock applied). This permission is given per Tenant, not device. If a new device is registered, you must select and apply the auto-lock function to that new device manually.</p>
                                <h3>Update the lock messages</h3>
                                <p>With the KG 1.38 release, customers can update the lock message per device without changing the device state.</p>

                                <p>There are three device relevant times which are found on the KG customer portal (Device table). These times are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li value="1">Device uploaded time</li>

                                <p>Each device time is available on the Device table as a separate column</p>
                                <p>The Agent version is also available on the Device table so customers are now able to view which version is installed on each device.</p>
                                <h3>Inform user of payment complete/Device unlock</h3>
                                <p>Customers can notify device users of status changes for better user experience. Messages can be sent when a payment has successfully been completed and the when the device has been unlocked after an overdue payment has been completed. These messages can be customized.</p>
                                <p>This feature is available via the KG console and by API calls</p>

                                <p>Devices where the tenants have enabled ‘URL enrollment’ permissions can enroll in KG via URL.</p>

                                <p>There have been some usability improvements for the Admin side of the KG client:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li value="1">If the Admin clicks ‘Go back to customer table’, it returns to the search result rather than the starting page</li>
                                    <li value="2">The ability to search a customer by Customer ID has been added</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>Improve activity log to capture all user actions generated in KG portal</h3>
                                <p>A new event will be logged whenever the ‘Search’ function is used and a detailed description containing the search keywords will be generated in the activity log. A new event will also be recorded in the activity log if the user logs out.</p>
                                <h3>Improve ‘Always show’ option for enrollment notification</h3>
                                <p>The option to set a non-dismissible message for Enrollment Notice worked only when ‘Always show on notification panel’ and ‘Show after completing enrollment’ were selected together. This was not by design because the two options are not dependent on each other.</p>
                                <p>There are two types of notifications:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li value="1">
                Persistent Notification: Notifications are always displayed on the notification panel once KG is enrolled and users cannot clear this notification as long as the device is enrolled to KG
            </li>
                                    <li value="2">
                Dismissible Notification: Configured when the enrollment notification is displayed (After enrollment or Device reboot)            </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>For KG 1.38, users can set each option separately without the two being dependent</p>

                                <p>Currently, KG categorizes customers as ‘End Customer’ or ‘Samsung Employee’. However, this does not cover all the KG business cases, especially Partnership model cases.</p>

                                <p>Because AD login is available within the Knox Portal, customers can access KG with their AD credentials.</p>
                                <p>If the AD is configured and the customer is logged in via AD login:</p>

                                <p>Customers can set their SIM Control policy based on the IMSI value. If a device detects a different IMSI value from what was registered (paired), the device will immediately get locked.

                                <p>This update introduces a SIM ‘Lock’ function for the PAYG model. This feature allows customers to prevent devices being resold to other countries by locking the device if a blocklisted SIM is inserted.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, a submenu called ‘Network registration verification’ checks if the inserted SIM (even for allowlisted SIM) is an active one</p>

                                <p>Devices get locked for various reasons and end-users try to unlock it through various methods. However, if a user does not know how to unlock, then they call the customer care center for assistance. This may increase call volume from the customer’s perspective and take more time to resolve the issue.</p>
                                <p>This feature can help customers by guiding them on how to unlock their devices or how to make a payment if needed. Through these messages, customers can save time and resolve their issues without having to call customer support.</p>

                                    <li value="1">Customer app is placed at the main lockscreen (the App icon is extracted from the apk and its title text can be customized by the customer)</li>

                                <p>Currently, some policies are applied to devices at the ‘completing’ status, which leads to issues if the device is locked due to the policy. ‘Completing’ is the prior step to complete which means the customer has made full payment and is waiting for the device to be released from KG control.</p>
                                <p>The policies have been removed once the device has made its payment. The removed policies include:</p>

                                <p>This enhancement addresses customers who are installing an app via KG, and want to auto-launch the app when the device is initially booted after app install. For more details on the feature, see 'Advanced controls' section in <a href="Manage_defaults.htm">Manage default policies</a>.</p>
                                <p>With this release, an option has been added to the App installation screen enabling an app to optionally launch automatically after installation so device users can use the app immediately. The app auto launches only at initial enrollment and factory reset.</p>
                                <h3>Localized device information </h3>
                                <p>Some Knox Guard supported countries use multiple languages. As a result, some customers want to send both customized and lock messages in the same language as the device language setting.</p>
                                <p>With this release, a customer can obtain language info using the <a href="../../devref/knox-guard/index.htm#operation/getDevicesUsingPOST" target="_blank">Knox Guard REST API (Get Device Info)</a>. Using the API, a customer can know the language utilization of the device. Once determined, the customer can send a message in multiple languages corresponding to the end-user device language. This feature is also supported on pay-as-you-go devices since it doesn't have any dependency on the KG service type.</p>
                                <h2>June 29th 2020 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>Trial to commercial license conversion enhancements</h3>
                                <p>To date, customers have been able to use trial licenses as needed to test their commercial devices in SLM, but commercial license conversion remains problematic. </p>
                                <p>
Going forward, trial licenses can now be converted to KG commercial licenses in SLM with greater ease. Additionally, trail to commercial license conversion is now reflected in the KG console, along with the
new 3 to 12-month activation period for the commercial license.
</p>
                                <h3>Device status enhancements</h3>
                                <p>With this release, the Knox Guard device state flow has been changed  to reduce limitations with any particular Knox Guard status state and enable admins to navigate seamlessly as events progress within the Knox Guard lifecycle.</p>
                                <p>In particular, the Overdue status state and its related information have been removed. This will help reduce customer confusion and communication overhead by eliminating a largely unused device state.
</p>
                                <p>Additionally, when a blink reminder is initiated for a payment delinquent device, an admin can now move directly to locking the device without releasing the blink reminder state. This helps reduce administration time by eliminating the need to place the device in an active state prior to initiating a device lock.
</p>
                                <p>For more information on Knox Guard status states, go to: <a href="antifraud-status-flow.htm">Knox Guard status flow</a>.</p>
                                <h2>February 26th 2020 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>New email management</h3>
                                <p>To date, a KG admin may receive too many emails when uploading devices, accepting devices, or deleting devices. Consequently, their computer may be unable to receive important system emails because their email inbox is full.

To address this issue, admins (including Super Admins) can now choose to receive system generated emails themselves for a specific group of system generated events.  For more information on where to locate this setting, go to <a href="about-the-dashboard.htm">About the dashboard</a>.</p>
                                <h3>Increased length of overdue and default lock screen messages</h3>
                                <p>Customers expressed the need to submit specific messages in several languages, and the 250m character maximum message length has proven inadequate in such instances. To address this request, the following notification and message length increases are implemented:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Default overdue notification message length – Increase to 500 characters</li>
                                    <li value="2">Default lock screen message length – Increase to 350 characters</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Console search capability improvements</h3>
                                <p>Recently the KG team has been fielding reports from customers stating it takes too long to search for devices using a partial search for approval ID from the KG console. As more devices are added into KG the search latency increases proportionally.
Going forward, only a full search will be supported of a device’s IMEI or approval ID. The expectation is device searches should now only take approximately one second.
</p>
                                <h3>Copyright notice added to all KG generated emails</h3>
                                <p>Going forward, each emails sent from either KG or the KG Samsung Admin console will have a copyright notice appended to the footer of the email. This requirement is based on a recent review requiring a copyright be appended to KG emails for legal compliance.</p>
                                <h3>Role deletion now permitted for all admin states other than active</h3>
                                <p>This feature addresses IT admin requests to delete a Knox Guard admin role with a pending, revoked or blocked state (any state but active). Prior to the role deletion, a message displays the intended admins impacted by the role deletion. Existing administrators assigned to the target role must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. For more information on where to locate this setting, see <a href="Manage_administrators.htm#h2_1">Delete a role</a>.</p>
                                <h2>December 18th 2019 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>New lock screen settings</h3>
                                <p>A lock command is typically delivered to a device when Wi-Fi is enabled and available at home, work etc. However, a device may be unable to receive an unlock command if the device user not at home or work and unable
to secure the required network connection. Even when a locked device user was to secure data connectivity at
their carriers store, their device lock screen still does not provide the means to change network connectivity setting to receive the unlock command. </p>
                                <p>To address this shortcoming, mobile data and Wi-Fi on/off settings are required on the Lock screen when the device is in a locked state. </p>
                                <h3>Updated license depletion notification email </h3>
                                <p>Currently, the email informing and admin of a low license count is not received in time to re-order before depletion.
</p>
                                <p>To better support our customer deployments and better ensure license seats can be re-applied before depletion,
we have changed the time and frequency license depletion emails are sent. With this release, admin emails are now sent when the license count is down to 10% (out of total) remaining seats, then another email when at 5%, and a final email at 3%.
</p>
                                <h3>Location tracking enhancements</h3>
                                <p>The Knox Guard team recently decided to remove the located device map from the console, since the utilization
of the map requires a contract requiring individual user consent. </p>
                                <p>
Going forward, the Knox Guard console will just display latitude and longitude data and provide a
means for an admin to integrate this data to the map service of their choosing.
</p>
                                <p>Once the device’s location is detected, its coordinates display as well as the time remaining before the next location refresh is available.

The location can be refreshed up to 10 times a day. Once viewed, the location display cannot be refreshed for 10 minutes.
The Locate device menu item only displays if the tenant has been granted permission, otherwise the menu item is hidden.
Only a single device can be selected at a time.
</p>
                                <h3>Approval ID search with special characters</h3>
                                <p>Customers often upload devices and approval IDs into Knox Guard, but are unable to search for a particular device using an approval ID,
since an approval ID is not a filterable column option. Additionally, there is a limitation on the special characters that can be used in a
search, even though approval IDs frequently use special characters like (/).
</p>
                                <p>To remedy this shortcoming, an approval ID is now included as a device search option within the <b>Devices</b> tab. Additionally, these special
characters will be supported as search parameters (@, :, $, /, *, %, ^, &amp;, \, (, ), +, ?, {}, [],). </p>
                                <h3>First time device upload enhancements</h3>
                                <p>Customers have reported frustration locating the portion of the Knox Guard console used for first time device uploads into Knox Guard. </p>
                                <p>

To reduce console navigation uncertainty, an <b>UPLOAD DEVICES</b> button has been added to the <b>Devices</b> screen.
Once selected, the Upload devices screen displays. A tool tip is also included describing the subsequent device upload actions
available to an admin by invoking this action. </p>
                                <h3>Device user overdue messaging enhancements</h3>
                                <p>Currently, payment overdue notifications can be easily ignored from the device’s notification center,
somewhat defeating the purpose of the overdue notification.
</p>
                                <p>
To make overdue notifications difficult to ignore, an <b>Initially show notifications as a
full-screen message on user’s device</b> checkbox option has been added to the <b>Default overdue notifications</b> screen.
When selected, the device user sees the fullscreen message before the message displays on the notification panel.
If unsure how the notification will display on the target user’s device, select <b>Preview fullscreen message</b>. </p>
                                <h3>Device event log collection</h3>
                                <p>Upon request, a device log has been implemented to capture events that are either sent automatically
when a specific condition is met or dynamically when a push commend is received from the Knox Guard server.
The device log is for internal debugging purposes and does not require a device user interface with log generation.
The receipt of diagnostic information is optional.</p>
                                <h3>Admins now capable of invitation to multiple services</h3>
                                <p>To date, an admin is unable to invite another admin belonging to a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or an admin with Admin invitation permissions can now invite an admin belonging to a different service to a role in their service. For example, Admin 1 belongs to just KG with a non-Super Admin role. Admin 2 belongs to KME with a non-Super Admin role, but has Admin invitation permissions. Therefore, Admin 2 can invite Admin 1 to join KME for any role for which Admin 2 currently has permission.</p>
                                <h2>September 25th 2019 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>Activity log updates for administrative roles</h3>
                                <p>With this release, the activity log has been enhanced to provide a broader range of Knox Guard administrative event changes. These administration events include, administrator invitations, administrator modifications, resent/reactivated/revoked invitations, and deactivated/reactivated accounts.</p>
                                <h3>Performance enhancements for console searches</h3>
                                <p>Currently, it takes too long to search device IMEIs, serial numbers and approval IDs within
Knox Guard Devices screen, since only a single query can be made at one time for a device search parameter.</p>
                                <p>To address this shortcoming, the Knox Guard console now permits more granular searches based on the IMEI&amp;SN, or ApprovalID selected as the search parameter. </p>
                                <p>This update will increase search response time and improve performance.</p>
                                <h3>View only permissions added </h3>
                                <p>This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator view only permissions.
Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access.</p>
                                <p>
When a <b>View only</b> radio button is selected, all nested options under that category (Devices and Uploads, Policies, Licenses, etc.)
are disabled. Additionally, if a radio button has nested options and that category does not have View only selected,
at least one of its permission checkboxes must also be selected. New roles have View only enabled by default.</p>
                                <h3>Added IMEI number to lock screen email</h3>
                                <p>To date, when a customer has locked the device of a delinquent user, the user sends an email from their Locked screen to their Customer Support. However, the IMEI has already been used to upload/enroll the device, and the customer cannot identify the Serial Number and are unable to locate the device within the Knox Guard console. </p>
                                <p>To remedy this issue, an additional IMEI field has been added to the email sent to Customer Support. Going forward, when a customer receives an email from a locked device user they should be able to view the IMEI of the device for easier reference and identification. </p>
                                <h2>August 28th 2019 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>Dashboard statistic and visualization enhancements</h3>
                                <p>With this release, the Knox Guard <b>Dashboard</b> has been enhanced with a new <b>DEVICE&#160;TRENDS</b>&#160;graph. The Device Trends graph displays Knox Guard event status for a selectable trending period.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, a new <b>Locked Device Types</b> graph provides a breakdown of the various device lock types occurring for currently locked devices during a selected trending period. The various lock types trended include Default locked, Offline locked, and SIM control locked. For more information on the Knox Guard Dashboard, go to: <a href="about-the-dashboard.htm">Dashboard</a>.</p>
                                <h3>CSV file enhancements</h3>
                                <p>To date, duplicate IMEIs display within a Knox Guard generated CSV file. These duplicate IMEIs can bloat the size of the file and skew the data in the file unnecessarily. </p>
                                <p>To remedy this situation, a shell script command is now run against the CSV file. The command keeps the initial response of the device IMEI within the file and removed subsequent duplicates. With duplicate entries removed, the file is generated faster, and is more beneficial to administrators trending actual device behavior.</p>
                                <h2>July 31st 2019 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>KG Rest API error return improvements</h3>
                                <p>API calls can only be made to device in a specific state. However, too many “device_state_invalid” errors have been encountered, and each time such an error occurs it’s difficult to determine a device’s accurate status to properly troubleshoot the problem.
</p>
                                <p>To resolve this issue, rather than calling “get device info” to obtain the state, the Knox Guard server will return the device state whenever a “device_state_invalid” error is triggered.</p>
                                <h3>Disable blink reminders for scheduled intervals</h3>
                                <p>Customers have reported blink notifications can bother their device users, especially at night and on weekends,
and have requested the ability to disable them for specific configurable periods.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="Resources/Images/blink_schedule.png" /> </p>
                                <p>With this release, customers can now disable blink reminders for a configurable period of time without stopping or starting the blink reminder again. During the time blink reminders are disabled, they will remain as notifications. </p>
                                <h3>Phone number or email address required for contact information</h3>
                                <p>With this release, either a phone number or email address is required when setting a blink reminder, lock (automatic lock), offline lock (warning),
or SIM control lock. With this requirement satisfied, a contact resource is now available if the device is rendered inoperable due to a device or SIM control lock.</p>
                                <h3>Last Seen parameter added for requesting customers</h3>
                                <p>A LAST SEEN column is now also available as a display option within the Knox Guard Devices screen.
This column displays the last time a listed device IMEI/SN connected to the KG server.
Both the Last Seen and Carrier fields are gated behind a feature flag so they can only be enabled for requesting customers.
</p>
                                <p>For more information on enabling this feature, contact your Knox Guard Samsung admin. </p>
                                <h3>Re-defined device log policies</h3>
                                <p>This update does not represent a change to existing Knox Guard statuses, and maintains the use of ~ing for various event states.
However, sent has been added to the event description to better distinguish what we sent clearly. For example, Unlock device has been updated to Unlock device sent.
Additionally, there has been so many device errors showing in device log that it becomes confusing
for the customer to discern legitimate errors from non-essential internal errors.</p>
                                <p>'
To remedy this confusion, the Knox Guard team has reduced the number of unnecessary internal errors and now only maintains valid errors interpreted as important to users.</p>
                                <h3>License usage dashboard improvements</h3>
                                <p>To date, when a license is added into Knox Guard and is activated the same month, the license utilization count within
the Knox Guard Dashboard does not properly increment and accurately reflect the update.
</p>
                                <p>To remedy this situation, the Dashboard has been updated to accurately reflect license activations within the same month they were added into the Knox Guard console.</p>

                                <h3>In process state cancellation improvements</h3>
                                <p>To date, when a device is in a transitional state, an admin is required to cancel the current in-process operation (Locking, Unlocking,
Completing, Starting Reminder, or Stopping Reminder) from the Device details screen before they can transition the device into a different desired state
With this enhancement, an admin can now move a device from the transitional state to an intended state without first canceling the in-process transitional state.
As a result, the <b>CANCEL</b> button has been removed the bottom each <b>Device details</b> screen.
Additionally, an admin can perform state transitions in batch mode for multiple devices by either selecting multiple devices or using a file.</p>
                                <h3>Carrier  information added to Device screen display</h3>
                                <p>To date, admins have not been able to discern a listed device’s carrier from the menu and filter options available within the Knox Guard <b>Devices</b> screen.
</p>

for display within the Devices screen. Additionally, Carrier is also available as an option within the Devices screen <b>STATUS</b> column.

                                <p>To date, customers are unsure whether Knox Guard is working as intended in respect to SIM card swaps and SIM swap data reporting. In particular, how many device users have attempted to swap their SIM card. With this release, SIM card change attempts can be logged and sent to the Knox Guard Server to provide greater visibility into potential device rooting events.
</p>
                                <p>To implement this enhancement, the Knox Guard  <b>Devices</b> screen has filter options added within the IMEI/SN column to select SIM Control enabled and/or SIM change attempts detected
</p>
                                <p>Additionally, a SIM card policy icon is added indicating when a SIM card change attempt is detected. A pop-up will display when hovering over the icon describing the SIM card change attempt in greater detail. </p>
                                <h3>Limitation added to administrator invitation role assignments</h3>
                                <p>To avoid the further escalation of Knox Guard administrative roles and permissions issues, an existing admin who does not have a manage roles permission requires additional restrictions regarding the roles they can assign to other administrators.
</p>
                                <p>With this release, existing administrators without a manage role permission can only invite admins with a matching set of their own role permissions. As a result, the <b>Invite administrator</b> screen’s <b>Role</b> drop-down menu choices have been customized for the particular role of the admin creating the invitation.
</p>
                                <h3>URL link available within overdue message and blink reminder preview image</h3>
                                <p>With this release, a properly formatted URL (http://www...) can be now included in the device preview image text defined for either an overdue payment notification or blink reminder. When the device user taps the URL hyperlink, it opens the relevant Web page within the device browser. The addition of the URL is optional, but could be of great assistance to subscribers who want to make device user payment queries as seamless as possible for their customers.   </p>
                                <h3>Dashboard statistics and visualization enhancements</h3>
                                <p>With this release the Knox Guard Dashboard has been updated to provide action success/fail rates and a License overview. Device SIM card changes are also displayed to provide greater visibility into potential; device rooting attempts. Hover over actions are also supported for more granular trending information. </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="Resources/Images/dashboard_actions.png" style="width: 544px;height: 390px;" />
                                </p>
                                <p>Each of these Dashboard enhancements has its own trending period drop-down menu as well as the ability to save graph content to a CSV or excel file for archive.  </p>
                                <h3>Customizable SIM&#160;messages</h3>
                                <p>Currently, a SIM change message is only supported in English, and the system defined message cannot be translated into other languages. Consequently, non-English customers cannot adequately protect against cheating and the resell of a device to a 2nd buyer when an installment balance is remaining. </p>
                                <p>To remedy this issue, a customizable SIM change notification is now displayed with every SIM change to help deter an unauthorized secondary device sale.
</p>
                                <h2>March 27th 2019 Knox Guard feature updates<br /></h2>
                                <h3>License count and  utilization enhancements</h3>
                                <p>This enhancement enables the console to only display 100% of the total ad remaining license seats available, as opposed to 110% of the seats available, which contributed to confusion over the actual number available for both total and remaining license seats. </p>
                                <p>Additionally, the number of assigned licenses now displays in red when the count exceeds 100% of the assigned allocation to more efficiently display and differentiate and exceeded allocation. The red exceeded license display is also accompanied by a pop-up message stating the license seat limit has been exceeded, and to contact your reseller to purchase more license seats to regain compliance. </p>
                                <h3>License usability console improvements</h3>
                                <p>Currently, the status and expiration date displayed in the console’s License menu do not adequately reflect the service period. Consequently, the license activation display requires an update to be meaningful in respect to the actual license activation and license seat consumption.
</p>
                                <p>To remedy this  issue, and reduce uncertainty with Knox Guard’s service license concept, the console’s <b>License</b> screen will be updated display additional information about the license’s activation, service period, and expiration date.
</p>
                                <p>Additionally, a new tool-tip is included to inform administrators the license expiration date is predicated on the actual license activation date. The Device screen is also updated to show the expiration date for each device utilizing the license, and the Device Details screen reflects a particular device’s license activation date.
</p>
                                <h3>Improved license consumption messaging </h3>
                                <p>When a Knox Guard admin enters a commercial license key, they need to informed of the new KCS&#160;license exhaustion policy. To address this issue, the KCS team has added an explanation to prevent mistakes using a commercial/trial license. </p>
                                <p>
The new message will state that if you enter a commercial key and use it for commercial purposes, you should delete the trial key used as a test first. If the Trial key remains or is newly added, that the trial key is exhausted first
</p>
                                <h3>Dashboard visualization improvements</h3>
                                <p>With this release, license status and consumption trending can be customized from the console’s Dashboard for more efficient license availability assessment.   </p>
                                <h3>SIM control notification customizations</h3>
                                <p>This feature addresses customer requests to send a customizable device notification message when an approved SIM is removed from a Knox Guard managed device. The message is intended to notify the device user their SIM cannot be detected, or is from an unsupported service provider and requires a different SIM. To address this request, the console UX has been updated to allow an admin to provide a customized message from the SIM control lock screen. </p>
                                <h2>March 3rd 2019 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>KG +&#160;KC/KME on the same device</h3>
                                <p>This feature enables KG and KC/KME services to be used together on the same device so customers can protect their devices with KG, use KC for automatic device configuration or re-branding updates, and also use KME for device enrollment, management and app installations.</p>
                                <p>
Typically, customers want to use KG with KC/KME to provide better device branding and management for deployments within their specific marker segments. In turn, this will drive up their sales, generate additional revenue for KCS, and expand the overall customer base for Knox services. </p>
                                <p>
To accommodate the combined use of these services, a reseller can now upload a device to KG as well as KC/KME using one customer ID and account.
</p>
                                <h3>Role-based access control (RBAC)</h3>
                                <p>This release introduces a new <i>Role-based access control</i> (RBAC) capability that allows customer (tenant) admins who are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though each supported Knox Cloud Service utilizes admin roles unique to that service, a Super Admin cuts across all supported services.
</p>
                                <p>With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service.
</p>
                                <p>The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available.
For information on creating a new admin account and assigning them unique roles and permissions, go to: <a href="manage-administrators.htm">Manage administrators</a>.</p>
                                <h3>Upload devices directly to the KG server</h3>
                                <p>Currently, to use devices in KG they must be purchased through a reseller. The customer must request registration (upload device IMEIs) in their reseller portal or using reseller API. Additionally, the customer can only use devices registered through their reseller within the KG console once approved and accepted with a valid KG license.
</p>
                                <p>However, the process described above does not enable non-carriers, such as financial institutions, to use KG since they are not in a physical device channel, or function as resellers. For such customers, the KG team has provided tenant permission control within the Samsung Admin portal and provided user permission control within the KG console to grant permissions to limited users. Additionally, an IMEI verification step has been added to ensure a wrong device IMEI is not auto-accepted and registered.
<br /></p>
                                <h3>Device deletion improvement for KG&#160;+&#160;KC/KME</h3>
                                <p>This feature introduces a new device deletion concept when KC/KME&#160;is deployed with Knox Guard. Once devices are uploaded to a customer ID&#160;with KG/KC/KME accesses, devices are added to all three consoles by default. If the customer would like to use only KG on their devices, they can remove those devices from just the KC and KME consoles only. </p>
                                <h2>December 5th 2018 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>An emergency message is now available on a locked device</h3>
                                <p>To date, a Knox Guard managed device cannot receive and display emergency messages when in a locked device state. This restriction can create serious legal issues in countries and regions where the broadcast of emergency messages is required. </p>
                                <p>
To remedy this situation, emergency messages are now displayed above a device’s lock screen while the device remains in its current locked state. No additional device-side screens are introduced with the addition of the emergency.
</p>
                                <h3>Offline device lock capability added</h3>
                                <p>To date, Knox Guard does not provide the ability to lock an offline device. Consequently, if a user does not purposely connect to network, the device is rendered out of Knox Guard control by not receiving its policy from its dedicated Knox Guard server.
</p>
                                <p>Beginning with this release, a device can be locked when out of network after a configurable period of time. Before the timer is expired and the device is locked, an admin can display an offline lock warning message at a defined frequency. Once an offline device is locked, the device user is required to contact their carrier to restore functionality. The device user must share the challenge code on their device's lock screen (generated when the device was locked), and then the admin provides a PIN to the device user to enter on their device to restore its functionality.  </p>
                                <p>The offline lock feature is only supported on devices running Android P or above.
</p>
                                <h3>Device unlock functionality update</h3>
                                <p>Beginning with this release, a device user and an IT admin must collaborate to unlock a device. An IT admin needs to generate a PIN from the passkey displayed on the user's device, then share the PIN with the device user to unlock their device. In this case, both the PIN generation algorithm and password generation method are updated.
</p>
                                <p>This device unlock update is only supported on devices running Android P or above. </p>
                                <h3>Separate default enrollment and SIM change messaging now available </h3>
                                <p>With this release, enrollment notices can be optionally enabled for end-user devices. Once globally enabled, separate completion of enrollment and SIM change messages can be optionally enabled as well. The completion of enrollment message is a customizable, 200-character maximum, message displayed once the setup wizard is completed on the device. The SIM card change message is a non-customizable message displayed when the SIM card is changed on the mobile device.</p>
                                <h2>October 31st 2018 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>Phone number within default enrollment notice now an optional parameter</h3>
                                <p>Prior to this release, the Phone number provided within the <b>Default enrollment notice</b> was a mandatory parameter.
</p>
                                <p>However, some subscribers have reported that they do not want to expose their customer’s (company) phone number within a Knox Guard enrollment notice.
Going forward, only a welcome and enrollment Message is required, and a phone number contact resource is optional.
</p>
                                <h2>October 4th 2018 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>Customizable app notification icon</h3>
                                <p>To remove the potential recognition of Samsung device management and control as much as possible, the enhancement provides an option to change the icons displayed within customer subscription notifications. Going forward, notification icons are interchangeable, just like overdue message icons.</p>
                                <h3>Knox Guard auto tour for console enhancements</h3>
                                <p>The Knox Guard auto tour is a new customer communication mechanism designed to communicate new updates to the Knox Guard console, especially changes impacting console navigation and the uncertainty that can result in the existing user base.</p>

                                <p>With this enhancement, a subscription payment overdue message template can now be edited by a Knox Guard admin  from within the Knox Guard console. Additionally, the number of overdue message templates available for message creation and selection is increased from 3 to 10.</p>
                                <h3>Accept multiple devices from console Devices menu</h3>
                                <p>To date, device acceptance options included accepting a single device at a time or accepting devices in bulk using a properly formatted CSV (.csv) file. To increase the device acceptance options available, multiple pending devices can now be selected from the console's Devices menu and accepted in a single operation. </p>
                                <h3>Excel file now available for bulk uploads</h3>
                                <p>To date, only a CSV file was available to support bulk uploads into the Knox Guard console. To enhance usability options going forward, am Excel file format (.xls) is also available to provide customers greater flexibility. </p>
                                <h3>Samsung images removed from device screens within console</h3>
                                <p>Samsung images have been removed from device screens displaying in the Knox Guard console to better reflect the ability to customize them to unique customer requirements.</p>
                                <h2>July 25th 2018 Knox Guard feature updates</h2>
                                <h3>New Knox Guard UX</h3>
                                <p>The Samsung Knox team is introducing a new version of Knox Guard console to provide optimal uniformity amongst our growing family of enrollment and configuration solutions. Knox customers will find the updated version of Knox Guard easier to navigate, as user interface elements have been logically combined to reduce the number of steps required to complete key management tasks. </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="Resources/Images/dashboard.png" />
                                </p>
                                <p>The central update is the introduction of a collapsible left-hand navigation menu, replacing the previous horizontal menu bar. This provides a visual hierarchy of  key Knox Guard payment management activities and administrator "call-to-actions." </p>
                                <p>The new Knox Guard console is personalized, with improved status updates from each user's previous login. Colorized status indicators optimally display "at-a-glance" event severity to administrate with best in class efficiency. </p>
                                <h3>In-process cancellation options added</h3>
                                <p>With this release, a <b>Cancel</b> link displays within the Device Details screen when the selected device Status is either <i>Locking, Unlocking, Completing, Starting Reminder</i>, or <i>Stopping Reminder</i>. This option allows the in-process operation to be stopped once begun if for some reason the operation was initiated in error or the device status needs to be reverted to its previous state.</p>

                                <h3>Knox Guard service APIs available</h3>
                                <p>Knox Guard service API can now be generated on behalf of a requesting company’s system. A developer generates an API key from Knox Guard Console and embeds the key in calls to the API. Data from the API is secured by whitelisting a specified IP address. If the API’s active key is lost or compromised, a new key can be regenerated and the old key deleted. Knox Guard APIs support device uploads, device acceptance, subscription payment overdue messaging and blink reminders, device lock/unlock, and licensing.</p>
                                <p>To use the API, a dedicated account requires creation by the Samsung Knox Guard team on behalf of the integrating customer. For more information, contact your Samsung Knox Guard representative. </p>
                                <h3>Auto-refresh enhancements</h3>
                                <p>To date, the data displayed within the console was not refreshing in real-time and consistently amongst all screens as data was updating, resulting in customer confusion as to what data is current and what requires a refresh. With this enhancement, console data is consistently auto-refreshed as data is changed or updated.</p>
                                <h3>Contact resource flexibility added</h3>
                                <p>With this release, a device user’s blink reminder and device lock contact resource can be provided as a phone number or E-mail address. Either a phone number or E-mail address is required, but now it is optional which subscriber contact type is used.</p>
                                <h3>Completing status cancellation period added</h3>
                                <p>If a device is marked as Payment Complete, its status changes to Completing… and remains this way for 2 days. The user has 2 days to cancel it while in the Completing… state, which reverts the device back to an Active state. If no action is taken after 2 days, the status changes to Payment complete and the Knox Guard application is uninstalled permanently. The device however is not automatically deleted from the server, and must be removed manually.</p>
                                <h3>Device deletion improved</h3>
                                <p>A Knox Guard admin can delete a device from the Knox Guard console when the device is in a payment complete or rejected state. When a device is deleted from Knox Guard, the device is removed from the server and the Knox Guard client is uninstalled. When deleted, all of the device's information and history are removed.</p>
