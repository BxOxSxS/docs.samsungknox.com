00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:06.033
As your business needs change, you may want to replace your license 

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:10.066
with a new one that provides more license seats or additional services.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:16.432
To replace and delete licenses, log in to your Knox Admin Portal, and go to Licenses.

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.199
Then, select the license you want to replace. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.733
We're going to replace this license that has a device enrolled to Knox Manage.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.166
 Click Actions and Replace license.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.766
Now you can choose a license to replace the one you selected.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.766
When you replace a license,

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:40.166
your devices move from the old license to the new one if all services they're enrolled in are available on the new license.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.199
You can also delete licenses that have no devices on them. 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.033
Simply click on the license name, and click Delete license.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.433
