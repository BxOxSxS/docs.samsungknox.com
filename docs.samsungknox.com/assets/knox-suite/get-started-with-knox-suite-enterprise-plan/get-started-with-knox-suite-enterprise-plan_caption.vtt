00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:07.333
Samsung Knox Suite is our all-in-one package of enterprise device management services,

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.399
bundled into three plans to best fit your business.

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:15.432
The Knox Suite Enterprise Plan, designed for large scale organizations, 

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.766
provides the widest range of capabilities,

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.399
from cross-platform endpoint management and remote troubleshooting,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.066
to comprehensive fleet data analytics, firmware control, and more.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:29.399
To get started with Samsung Knox Suite, 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.100
you'll need to register for an account at samsungknox.com

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.533
When you sign-up

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:40.066
you get a 90-day trial license that lets you explore our services on up to 30 devices.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.433
After you sign-in to the Knox Admin Portal, 

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.533
you can begin using a service by enrolling a device, 

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.233
which starts the 90-day trial and consumes a license seat

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:55.066
Let's see what happens when we enroll a device into our data analytics service,

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.166
Knox Asset Intelligence

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:01.666
Once it's enrolled, we can view data for that device on the dashboard

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.232
When you enroll the rest of your device fleet,

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:09.699
Knox Asset Intelligence provides a comprehensive analysis of your fleet's status and health

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:13.966
For details about enrollment, please see our how-to guides

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.966
or check out our documentation at docs.samsungknox.com.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:22.966
Once your devices are enrolled, you can check the licenses page and click on a license.

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.466
This shows the services your devices are enrolled in,

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:31.932
and how many devices are active on your Knox Suite Enterprise Plan license.

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:36.499
Note that a single device using multiple services in the bundle

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.266
only takes up one seat on your license

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.666
Once your trial period ends,

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:46.466
you must purchase a commercial license key in order to continue using our services

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:50.866
To get a commercial license, click Actions and Get a license.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:57.299
Where you can find Knox license resellers near you to purchase a commercial Knox Suite Enterprise Plan

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.566
After you purchase a license, your reseller can add it to your account for you,

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:06.666
or you can enter your license key under Actions to activate it manually.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:12.599
