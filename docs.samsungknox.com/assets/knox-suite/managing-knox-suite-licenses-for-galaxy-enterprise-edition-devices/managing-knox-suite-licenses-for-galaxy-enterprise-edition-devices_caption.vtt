00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:11.784
Hello and welcome to this Samsung Knox training video on managing

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:14.761
Knox Suite licenses for Enterprise Edition devices.

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:19.390
Note that this video only covers Knox Suite licenses included with Enterprise Edition devices,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.999
and not standalone Knox Suite licenses. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.332
Let's get started.

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.733
Enterprise Edition is an offering that bundles devices together with a 

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.733
one-year renewable Knox Suite license, and up to five years of 

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.599
security maintenance from the year of device launch.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.282
Before you can manage licenses for Enterprise Edition devices, 

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:44.816
you must first have a Samsung Knox account to access the Knox Admin Portal.

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:50.162
You'll also need to purchase Enterprise Edition devices from an authorized Samsung device reseller

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:52.299
and have them uploaded to your account.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:58.199
Once your devices are uploaded, you can access the Enterprise Edition dashboard. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.066
This is where you'll manage the Knox Suite licenses for these devices.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:05.259
There are three ways to access the dashboard: 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.499
either through the Knox highlights card, 

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.566
the Licenses page, 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.400
or the Additional solutions page.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.551
To access the dashboard through the Licenses page, click ACTIONS, then click Get a license. 

00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:26.033
Then at the bottom of the dialog, click GENERATE KNOX SUITE LICENSE.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.700
On the Enterprise Edition dashboard, you’ll see a list of devices 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.966
uploaded by each of your resellers.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.233
When generating a Knox Suite license for Enterprise Edition devices,

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:41.233
pay attention to the number in the REMAINING DEVICES column, as this

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:45.099
indicates the number of devices you can generate a license for.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.514
Note that you can't generate a license if the number is zero, as this means that 

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:53.099
all Enterprise Edition devices uploaded by this reseller 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.800
already have a Knox Suite license generated.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:59.995
To generate a license, select a reseller upload from the table, 

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:03.599
then click ACTIONS, followed by Generate license.

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:08.487
On the dialog, select a start date for your new Knox Suite license. 

00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:12.065
This can be any date, up to six months in the future.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:16.033
Click GENERATE to create the license for the newly uploaded devices. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.835
After you generate a license, the number in the DEVICES WITH LICENSE GENERATED column 

00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:24.899
should increase by the number of licenses generated. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.954
The number in the REMAINING DEVICES column will be zero when every Enterprise Edition device 

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:33.299
uploaded by that reseller has received a license.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.500
Note that Enterprise Edition devices only activate their licenses 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.871
after they enroll into a Knox service. 

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:44.085
As enrollment steps may vary depending on the service. 

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:48.633
Please see the documentation on each service for complete enrollment information.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.690
If you purchase additional Enterprise Edition devices from the same reseller, 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.431
and the reseller uploads them to your account after a license is already generated for the previous batch, 

00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:04.682
then you'll see the number of UPLOADED DEVICES increase by the number of additional devices you purchased.

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:11.192
In the REMAINING DEVICES column, you'll also see the number of newly added devices eligible for a license. 

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:15.560
For these new devices, you can choose to either generate a brand-new license key, 

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:20.348
or append these devices to the same license key generated for the last batch.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.383
Appending simply means that all of the newly uploaded devices are added as seats to your existing license, 

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:30.830
eliminating the need to generate and manage another separate license key.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.427
Note that appending devices changes the license expiration date 

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:36.766
for all devices sharing the same key.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:42.699
To append, select a reseller upload from the table, then click ACTIONS, 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.232
followed by Append to an existing license.
 

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:48.190
You’ll see a list of your existing license keys, 

00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:53.233
their associated reseller, the number of seats, and the license's expiration date.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.933
Select which license to append the new devices to, then click CONTINUE. 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.360
The number of seats in the appended license will increase 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.566
by the number of devices in the latest reseller upload. 

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:09.773
You'll also see an adjusted expiration date for your license after devices are appended to it.

00:04:09.774 --> 00:04:12.499
Note that the license key remains the same.

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:18.912
If you want to append all future device uploads from this reseller, you can select the option here. 

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:23.733
Any new uploads will be automatically added as seats to your existing license key.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.585
Click APPEND to add the new devices to your existing license. 

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:31.165
The number in the REMAINING DEVICES column should now be zero.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.684
If you have multiple Enterprise Edition Knox Suite licenses, 

00:04:35.684 --> 00:04:39.369
you can merge licenses if they are either from the same reseller, 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.065
or have no reseller, and if the licenses haven't been assigned to any devices.

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:50.597
For example, if you have an unused license with 3 seats, and another one with 7 seats, 

00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:54.133
you can combine them into a 10-seat license instead. 

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:58.133
To merge, click ACTIONS, then click Merge license.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:01.695
On the next page, pay attention to the STATUS column.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:05.132
You can only merge license keys that are Active. 

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:08.299
Click the merge icon on the key you'd like to merge,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.633
then click NEXT. 

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:14.132
On the next dialog, select which key you want to merge into, 

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:15.466
then click NEXT.

00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:20.366
Note that merging licenses also updates the expiration date of the merged key. 

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:22.899
Click MERGE to combine the keys. 

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:31.666
