00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.933
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:14.366
In this video, we'll show you how to get started with using Knox Capture.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:21.933
Knox Capture is an Android solution that lets enterprise IT admins transform their organization's

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:27.799
Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets into barcode scanners that can read, process, 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.533
and output barcode information into other applications.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.032
By the end of this video, you'll learn how to

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:42.066
Get a license, use the default Knox Capture profile, change scan engine settings

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:49.232
and keystroke output rules, test a scanning configuration, export a scanning configuration,

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:54.333
deploy the scanning configuration using Knox Manage,

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:59.533
and finally we'll demonstrate how to use the Knox Capture application as an end-user.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Before you can begin using Knox Capture, you’ll need to have the following:

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.766
A valid Samsung Knox account, in order to be able to get a Knox Suite license.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:15.499
If you do not already have one, please go to samsungknox.com and click Enroll to register.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.933
While Knox Capture can be deployed using most EMMs,

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:23.733
this video will explain the deployment process using Samsung Knox Manage.

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:31.199
If you want to follow along with this video, you also need access to the Knox Manage service in the Knox Admin Portal.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.600
Please refer to our Knox Admin Portal documentation at docs.samsungknox.com for instructions on how to enable the service.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.166
You’ll need a Samsung device in order to create and test scanning configurations as an IT admin

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:51.766
You can find a link to the list of compatible devices in the video descriptions below.

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:56.899
And optionally, if you’d like to test Knox Capture from the end-user’s point of view, 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.100
you’ll need that device enrolled into Knox Manage, or any EMM of your choice.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.600
The first thing you’ll need to do is install Samsung Knox Capture from Google Play.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.266
Once the application is installed, tap Open.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:17.199
After reviewing and accepting the Terms of Service and Knox Privacy Policy, tap Agree.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.700
When you land on the Knox Capture main screen for the first time, 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.400
you’ll see several tips to help guide you through the application. Tap Dismiss all if you want to hide the tips.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:35.133
All Samsung Knox Capture users automatically get a free trial when they install the app for the first time. 

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:44.633
This free trial lets you explore the application’s features and perform up to 100 barcode scans before prompting for a Knox Suite license key.

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:53.866
Once you have the Knox Suite license key, tap the options menu on the Knox Capture main screen, then tap License to activate the key. 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.733
Once activated, tap the back button to return to the main screen.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:06.666
A Scanning Profile is a core Knox Capture feature that defines how the barcode scanner behaves. 

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:14.399
Primarily the profile specifies which apps can launch a barcode scan, which barcode types are accepted,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.400
whether the camera has any special behavior like flash or zoom, and how to process barcode data after scanning.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:31.600
Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.466
In other words, when Knox Capture is launched,

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:41.166
any app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. 

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:47.699
This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.700
Let’s begin by tapping Default scanning profile on the main screen.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.933
On the profile screen, you’ll have access to various profile configuration options.

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:07.766
You can change any default setting except the profile’s apps, since the default profile works with all apps on the device.

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:15.732
At any time, you can reset the default profile back to its original settings by tapping the options button,

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:19.466
then selecting Reset default profile.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:23.866
Now let’s explore some of the key profile configuration options.

00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:32.132
In the default profile screen, under Scanner, tap Knox Capture to view the profile’s scan engine settings.

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:36.133
Here is where you can define overall scanning behavior.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.533
Let’s change a few barcode types in the settings.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:43.533
The default profile already includes the most commonly used barcode types, 

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:48.733
but you can add or remove barcodes from the list by tapping them, then tapping Save.

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:57.333
Under Scan Settings, you can specify the scan mode, and enable features like beeping or vibrating after each scan. 

00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:01.933
Let’s disable the beep but keep the vibrate after each scan.

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:09.633
Review any other scan engine settings you’re interested in, then tap the back button to return to the profile screen.

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:18.666
Let’s now configure some Keystroke output rules. These rules define how barcode data gets processed after each scan. 

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:25.099
For example, you can add a Tab or Enter key, or special characters like a dollar or pound sign,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.166
before or after each barcode string.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:35.132
In our example, we’ll add a couple of keystroke rules to our default profile.

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:39.399
Under Keystroke output, we’ll tap Send Enter character as. 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.400
This step defines how we want to process the Enter key in our profile.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.733
In our case, we’ll process this as a key event, 
to emulate hitting Enter on a keyboard. 

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:57.499
Then in Basic data formatting, we’ll add a character at the beginning of our barcode.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.700
In our example, we’ll add a dollar sign by tapping Prefix for data, then entering our dollar sign character and tapping Save.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:15.033
Next, because we want to use an Enter key in our barcode data, we’ll need to append the Enter character after each scan.

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:22.333
We've now created some basic keystroke output rules and changed some scan engine settings. 

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:27.133
The next thing we'll want to do is test the profile to see if it works.

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:33.166
Once the default scanning profile has been configured, you can use it to test Knox Capture. 

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:39.766
This allows you to verify that your scan engine and keystroke output settings are working as intended.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:47.999
To test Knox Capture, go to the main screen and tap the options button, then select Test apps.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.900
Find the app that you want to perform a barcode scan with.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.400
In our example, we’ll select Samsung Notes as our scanning application, then Tap Open.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.166
When your test app launches, you’ll see a pop-up letting you know that you’re testing the app with Knox Capture. 

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:14.699
This pop-up provides information about the scanning profile, and its relevant scan engine and keystroke output rules.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.100
You can position this pop-up by holding and dragging it anywhere on the screen.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:28.766
If you tap on any user input field, you should see a Samsung keyboard appear with a Knox Capture camera trigger icon.

00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:34.566
Tap this icon to launch the camera, then aim the camera at any barcode.

00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:40.499
Once Knox Capture scans the barcode, it processes and places the data into the app, 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.500
along with any keystroke output rules that you configured.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.700
In our example, we see that a dollar sign was placed as a prefix to the data, 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.333
and our cursor was moved to a new line because we appended an Enter key event.

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:59.333
The test mode pop-up also gets updated after each scan.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:03.733
Here, you’ll see information about the barcode symbology used,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:08.333
and what the original data looked like before applying keystroke output rules.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:16.999
Let’s perform another barcode scan to see what happens. Notice how our keystroke output rules get applied again,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.533
with a dollar sign prefix, and an Enter key event appended to each data string.

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:28.199
To exit test mode, tap the X in the pop-up, then tap Close.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.033
This will exit out of Knox Capture test mode, but you’ll remain in the app.

00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:37.466
Let’s switch back to the Knox Capture application. 

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:42.366
You’ll see a green checkmark to indicate that you’ve tested this app with Knox Capture. 

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:47.399
Tap the back button to return to the Knox Capture main screen.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.666
Then, if you want to test another app, you can repeat the same process.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:09:00.199
If you’re satisfied with your scanning profile, you’ll need to share the configuration with an EMM administrator

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.066
in order for them to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices.

00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:13.132
There are several ways to share a scanning profile configuration. In this video, we’ll share it over email. 

00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:19.299
To do this, go to the main screen and tap the Share button, then select Email.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.966
after you send the configuration from your device, the EMM admin will receive an email

00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:31.099
with an attached configuration text file, along with instructions on how to deploy the configuration.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.200
For this video, we’ll walk you through the deployment process using Knox Manage.

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:41.366
Once you sign into Knox Manage, go to Application, then click Add.

00:09:41.366 --> 00:09:50.299
In Managed Google Play, search for Samsung Knox Capture, then click Select, then Save &amp; Assign.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:58.966
In the Assign Application page, go to Managed Configuration, then click Set Configuration.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:02.966
In the first field, give your configuration a name.

00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:08.699
In the second row, click Configure to enable the Knox Capture Configuration field. 

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:15.966
Then copy and paste the contents of the configuration text file from the email into this field.

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:22.799
For the third row, click Configure again to enable the Knox Capture License field. 

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.333
Copy and paste your Knox Suite license key into this field, then click Save. 

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:35.666
Back on the Assign Application page, select a group then click Assign, then OK. 

00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:40.932
This pushes Knox Capture as a managed application onto the end user’s device. 

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:47.733
Once the end-users receive Knox Capture as a managed application on their devices,

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:51.733
they can begin to use Knox Capture in managed mode.

00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:59.933
When Knox Capture is running in managed mode, the end-user can perform barcode scans using the profile set by the administrator.

00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:08.333
They can also view the scanning profile settings, by tapping the options button, then tapping View current configuration.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:15.474
If the user taps the scanning profile given to them - in our case, the default scanning profile - they can information about

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:21.199
their scan engine settings and keystroke output rules that were applied by the IT administrator.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.833
Back on the device user's main screen, they can also enable a floating action button

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:33.166
that allows them to trigger a camera scan, using a button that displays on every screen.

00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:41.866
And if users are using specialized rugged devices like the Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, 

00:11:41.866 --> 00:11:45.166
they can change the hardware key that triggers a camera scanner.

00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:49.999
By default, it's set to the XCover key, on the left side of the device,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.500
but users can change this key to the top or the right-side keys, to trigger the scanner.

00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:01.699
Let's now perform a barcode scan as an end user.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.766
To do this, open an application. In our example, we'll use Samsung Notes.

00:12:06.766 --> 00:12:15.966
Once you tap your user input field, the Samsung keyboard should appear and you should see a Knox Capture camera trigger icon.

00:12:15.966 --> 00:12:18.766
Tap the icon to scan a barcode.

00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:26.632
Once the barcode is scanned, the Keystroke output rules will get applied and the data will be inserted into the application.

00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:30.633
In our example, we can see that the prefix of a dollar sign,

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.233
and the Enter key was applied to our barcode data.

00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:36.866
Let's scan a few more barcodes to test this further, 

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:42.799
and you can see that several barcodes have been scanned with the appropriate Keystroke output rules applied.

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:48.599
This now concludes our video on getting started with Knox Capture.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.600
