00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.366
If you want to make changes to an origin profile and apply those changes to a target customer, 

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:09.588
you'll need to overwrite the copied profile on the target customer's account.

3
00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:13.192
Overwriting primarily involves repeating the copying process,

4
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:17.966
and replacing the previously copied profile with the updated origin profile.

5
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:23.066
To update or overwrite a copied profile, you'll need to do the following:

6
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.273
First make your changes to the origin profile. 

7
00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:30.191
You can quickly do this by going to the COPYABLE PROFILES tab,

8
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:33.912
then clicking the name of the origin profile you want to update.

9
00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:39.644
In our example, let's imagine that we want to update our original Knox Manage profile. 

10
00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:44.066
Click the profile name to go to the origin customer’s Knox Manage console.

11
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.914
Make your changes as required.

12
00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:54.133
In our example, we'll update our KSP policies 1 profile to allow devices to have a factory reset.

13
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.691
After making the profile changes, head back to the Knox MSP Portal, 

14
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:03.465
then go to the COPYABLE PROFILES tab on the Profiles page.

15
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:08.631
For Knox Manage profiles specifically, you'll see an updated version number in the 

16
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:12.632
PROFILE INFO column letting you know that the profile was changed.

17
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:19.866
Select the updated profile from the list, then click Actions, Copy or overwrite profile to customers.

18
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:23.866
After selecting the target customer, ensure that the profile name 

19
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:28.459
on the target customer's account matches the name of the profile that you want to overwrite, 

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.733
then click CREATE PROFILES, then CONFIRM.

21
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:36.856
If you want to remove an origin profile from the COPYABLE PROFILES table, 

22
00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:42.566
you can simply select it from the list, then click Actions, Remove copyable profile.

23
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.766
Note that removing the profile from the list doesn't actually remove

24
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.699
the profile from either the origin or target customer's accounts.

25
00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.033
If you want to permanently remove the profiles, you'll need to go into each 

26
00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.399
customer's account and manually delete them from the console.

27
00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.397
This concludes part two of the MSP profile video series, 

28
00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:12.582
