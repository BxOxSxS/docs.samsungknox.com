1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.749
While giving your copied profile a name, you can also review the 

2
00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:09.799
EXPECTED RESULT column to see if the new profile name already exists in the target customer's account. 

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:15.166
If the name DOESN'T already exist, then a new copied profile is created.

4
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:21.339
If the name DOES exist, and the origin profile matches the existing copied-profile's origin, 

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.466
then the existing copied-profile is overwritten.

6
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:28.766
If the name DOES exist, and the origin profile DOES NOT match 

7
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.066
the existing copied profile's origin, then you'll see an error. 

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.500
To help illustrate these points, let’s imagine that you want to copy 

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.233
a Knox Manage profile, called "KSP policies 1", from Customer A to Customer B.

10
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:48.232
If customer B doesn't already have a copied-profile called "KSP policies 1", 

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.166
then a new profile is created on their account.

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.101
If customer B already has a copied profile called "KSP policies 1",

13
00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:02.946
and this profile is a copy of the original "KSP policies 1" profile from Customer A, 

14
00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.599
then customer B's profile is overwritten.

15
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:11.166
If customer B already has a copied-profile called "KSP policies 1", 

16
00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:16.677
but that profile's origin is not the same as "KSP policies 1" from Customer A,

17
00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:18.433
then an error occurs. 

18
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:25.433
For example, copying a profile named "KSP policies 2" from Customer A to Customer B,

19
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.233
but renaming it as "KSP policies 1" would produce an error, 

20
00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:30.279
but renaming it as "KSP Policies 1" would produce an error, 

21
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.133
as the origin profile would be different between the two accounts.

22
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:39.658
On the Customize profile names page, you'll see an error in the Expected Results column 

23
00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:42.430
letting you know that no action will be taken. 

24
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.432
If you create the profile, the console will show a "Failed to copy" error message.

25
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.700
This concludes the video on how to understand and troubleshoot profile naming.

26
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.048
