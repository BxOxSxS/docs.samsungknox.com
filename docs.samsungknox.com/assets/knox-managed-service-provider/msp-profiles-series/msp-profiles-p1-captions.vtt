00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.411
The Knox MSP Portal's Copy Profile feature allows managed service providers

2
00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:11.399
to duplicate Enrollment, Knox Configure, and Knox Manage profiles across customer accounts.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.830
This streamlines the deployment of standardized configurations, eliminating the 

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.366
need to manually recreate identical profiles for each account.

5
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:23.866
For instance, if a Knox Manage profile for Customer A 

6
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.786
includes specific Knox Service Plugin policies, 

7
00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:30.257
the same profile can be copied and applied to Customer B, 

8
00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:32.732
saving time and ensuring consistency.

9
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:38.937
To use the Copy Profile feature, you must first make a profile “available for copying”. 

10
00:00:38.937 --> 00:00:44.837
For example, if Customer A has a Knox Manage profile that you want to apply to Customer B, 

11
00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:50.999
then you must add Customer A's profile to the Knox MSP Portal and make it available for copying.

12
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:56.163
To do this, go to the Profiles page on the Knox MSP Portal, 

13
00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:58.366
click the COPYABLE PROFILES tab,

14
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.366
 then click ACTIONS, Add copyable profiles.

15
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.199
In our example, we'll add a copyable Knox Manage profile.

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.107
On the following page, you'll see a list of every profile that can be copied. 

17
00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:16.064
Note that you can only copy profiles from fully-managed customer accounts. 

18
00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:21.117
If a profile is created in a Jointly-managed customer's account, then it cannot be copied.

19
00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:26.722
Select the copyable profiles you wish to add, or use the search bar to filter by a specific 

20
00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:31.293
customer name, customer ID, or profile name, then click NEXT. 

21
00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:34.999
This will add the profiles to the Copyable Profiles table.

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.383
Once a profile is added to the Copyable Profiles table, 

23
00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:42.325
it can be copied to your other managed customers' accounts.

24
00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:48.785
In the table, select the profiles you wish to copy, then click ACTIONS, Copy or overwrite to customer.

25
00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:54.237
On the next page, enter the name of the customers you wish to copy the original profile to. 

26
00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:57.499
Up to 10 customers can be selected at a time.

27
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.621
Click NEXT, then on the following page, you can give your copied profile a name. 

28
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.865
This is the name of the profile that appears on the target customer's account. 

29
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.625
By default, this is the same name as the origin profile, 

30
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:15.099
however, you can change it to something that helps you identify the profile easier. 

31
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.702
Note that changing this name only affects the target customer's account. 

32
00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:24.032
The profile name on the origin customer's account remains the same.

33
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.890
After you review or change the copied-profile name, click CREATE PROFILES,

34
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.366
then review the information on the pop-up and click CONFIRM. 

35
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:40.008
Once the profile is copied, you can find it in one of the respective Knox services tabs on the Profiles page.

36
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:45.899
In our example, we can find our copied Knox Manage profile in the Knox Manage tab.

37
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.403
This concludes the first video on copying profiles in the Knox MSP Portal. 

38
00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:55.060
Check out the other videos in the series to learn how you can update, 

39
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.735
overwrite, and remove copied profiles,

40
00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:02.699
and how to manage copied Enrollment and Knox Manage profiles on behalf of your customers.

41
