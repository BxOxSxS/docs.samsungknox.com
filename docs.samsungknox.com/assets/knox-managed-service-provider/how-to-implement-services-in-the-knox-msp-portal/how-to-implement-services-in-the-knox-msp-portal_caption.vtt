00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.600
Welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.966
In this video, We would like to introduce use cases of Knox MSP portal that shows how a managed service provider can differentiate 

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:24.532
managed services with Samsung devices and Knox solutions through Knox MSP Portal.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:31.399
The Knox Managed Service Provider (MSP) Portal empowers Knox MSPs with robust and adaptable management capabilities across 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.133
Samsung devices and Knox Solutions. 
Recently, Knox Asset Intelligence and Knox Remote Support have been enabled on Knox 

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:44.033
MSP portal. 
In conclusion, Knox Managed Service Providers can make full use of Knox Suite 

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:52.099
products and features for their customers.
Knox MSPs are able to efficiently navigate and utilize Knox Suite functionalities through Knox 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.933
MSP Portal where a smooth and frictionless  experience to manage multiple customers and products is assured.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:03.199
With Knox Asset Intelligence, you can support a quality and enhanced device management service remotely.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.033
Effective monitoring of battery performance and identification of applications that contribute to excessive battery drain are vital for ensuring 

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:18.066
optimal device longevity and user satisfaction. By closely monitoring battery performance, you can promptly detect any potential issues and 

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:24.566
take appropriate actions to address them. This includes identifying and managing applications that consume a significant amount of battery 

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:32.132
power, either by optimizing their power usage or disabling them when necessary. By proactively managing battery drain concerns, 

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:38.366
you can extend the overall battery life of devices and provide a seamless user experience, ultimately improving device 

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.732
performance and user satisfaction.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:41.866
Let’s get started.

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:50.399
Firstly, begin by logging in at partner.samsungknox.com and launch your MSP Portal by clicking ‘Knox MSP portal’ on 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.433
the left hand side.

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:59.599
In your Knox MSP Portal, you can enter to a KAI console of your particular customer in order to help them manage their devices.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.133
If you can't find KAI console for your customer, you can enable it by following simple steps.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.033
1) Click a name of you customer 

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:19.466
2) Click "Manage account" button
3) Click a checkbox or Knox Asset Intelligence and Save button

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:26.332
Now go to Battery insights under the Dashboard, you will see number of general battery-related insights as miniature charts 

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:31.866
there.
The&nbsp;Battery state of health&nbsp;tile shows your enrolled devices split between&nbsp;Good,&nbsp;Normal, 

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:38.799
or&nbsp;Bad&nbsp;states. These states represent the overall health of each device's battery, and how much of its original charge the battery can hold. 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:50.233
Good means 75% &amp; above, Normal means 55 to 75% and Bad means 55% &amp; lower. Hover over a chart segment to see the devices in that 

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:57.166
category and the overall percentage of the fleet or group it covers.
If needed, you can find specific data by 

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:06.299
selecting the time frame e.g. last 30 or 60 days etc. Also, you can group devices to track only specific group of devices.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:19.133
Now go to Apps insights under the Dashboard, you will see number of general apps-related insights as miniature charts there.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.633
The Apps with highest battery consumption&nbsp;tile shows the top five apps that consume the most battery on average, per 

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:37.499
device and per day.
Similar to battery insights, you can find specific data by selecting the time frame or specific 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.533
group of devices. Also you can select managed or unmanaged apps you want to see.
You can specify the managed &amp; unmanaged 

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:50.499
apps by going into dashboard setting &amp; managed apps tab.

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:07.466
If you as a Managed Service Provider need to directly look into an issue on customer’s device by remotely accessing to the device, 

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:08.999
you can use Knox Remote Support.

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:15.266
Managed Service providers can not only pre-install a Knox Remote Support agent on device 

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:21.566
through EMM, but also send an SMS to the device user to start remote support after you get the agreement of the user.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:36.633
After Knox Remote Support is activated, Managed Service providers can look at the device screen and capture and transfer it, to 

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.099
further analyze and resolve issues.

00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:51.399
When you find battery issues on few of your customer' devices you may need to instantly inform that they need to get their devices or 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.900
batteries swapped.
You can make use of “push notification” device command from Knox Manage console to inform 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.733
the user.
You can do this by going into Knox manage console, find the user of the device, click on it 

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:12.499
then press 'device command' button. Now click on 'push notification' command, fill in the message you want to send and press 'ok'.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:32.566
And with that, we have reached the end of our video on leveraging the Knox MSP Portal to unlock your business potential. Now, you have 

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:39.999
the necessary insights to make the most of Knox solutions and Samsung devices. Take this opportunity to explore and utilize the key 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.300
