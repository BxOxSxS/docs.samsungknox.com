00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.500
Welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.700
In this video, we’ll show you how to add sub-admins and assign them roles and customers within the Knox MSP Portal.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.666
Let’s get started.

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:25.132
Firstly, begin by logging in at partner.samsungknox.com and launch your MSP Portal

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.733
by clicking Knox MSP portal on the left hand side.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:35.399
You can now begin to add roles for your sub-admins. Start by navigating to Roles on the left side menu. 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:45.466
Note, by default, if you do not add any custom roles, all sub-admins will be given an “MSP Admin role”. To view what permissions this role 

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:53.032
gives your admins, click the MSP Admin role name to view its permissions.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:59.766
On this page, you will be able to create specific roles for your sub-admins to limit their capabilities to specific tasks. 

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:06.366
For example, you can create a specific “Helpdesk” role for 1st line support which can allow tasks such as:

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:11.732
Viewing Profiles but not being able to edit them;
Manage licenses on behalf of customers;

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.699
View MSP devices and uploads but not delete them;

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.400
You can create multiple different roles for different administrators depending on the requirements of your organization.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.566
Once you have named your role and selected the permissions required, press the SAVE button to create that role. 

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:31.299
Now that your roles have been created, you can now add your sub-admins to your MSP Portal. 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.800
Click on the Administrators tab on the left side menu.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.666
This page will show you all your existing Administrators and their roles, along with which customers they may have access to. 

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.199
In the top right, you can click “Invite Administrator”.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.233
Enter the details of the sub-admin such as First Name, Last Name, Email Address

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:55.499
Then you can select which Role this sub-admin should be assigned. For example, you can select your newly created “Helpdesk” role.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.200
Also, as a Super Admin, you have the ability to create sub-admins with limited access to specific customers. This enables you to restrict

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.500
helpdesk staff from managing complex customer environments,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.666
reserving such access exclusively for 2nd/3rd line support staff.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:14.299
Once you have finished inputting all the admin details press INVITE button.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.966
Now that you have invited your sub-admins, they will receive an invite Email asking them to sign up for SamsungKnox.com.

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:25.699
Once they follow the sign-up steps, they will have access to your organizations MSP portal.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.333
The Knox MSP Portal provides flexibility and security to only allow your sub-admins access to specific roles and customers.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:40.366
