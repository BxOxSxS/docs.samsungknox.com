00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:15.999
Welcome to the Knox video training series. 
In this video, you’ll learn how to get started with the Knox Managed Service Provider Portal (or 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.833
simply known as the Knox MSP Portal). 
We’ll show you how to access the MSP Portal, how to add and manage customers, devices, 

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:32.966
and licenses, and how to use the Profiles feature to easily copy Knox Configure profiles from one customer to another.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:40.599
Let’s get started!
Before you can use the Knox MSP Portal, you’ll need to first enroll into the Knox Partner 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Program (or KPP) as a Managed Service Provider. 
To do this, go to partner.samsungknox.com/msp

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.466
then click Become a Partner in the top right to begin the enrollment process.
Once you provide your work email and follow 

00:00:55.466 --> 00:01:00.832
the instructions on screen, a Samsung Knox portal admin will review and approve your application. 

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:11.499
When approved, you’ll be able to launch the MSP Portal the next time you sign into the KPP. 
After enrollment, you’ll need to obtain Knox 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.333
customer IDs from any existing Knox customers that you want to manage. 
You’ll then need to purchase licenses for any 

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:25.599
Knox cloud services that you want to manage on behalf of the customer.
Let’s sign into the KPP and launch the Knox 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.600
MSP Portal from the left navigation menu.
By default, you’ll land on the Knox MSP Portal’s Dashboard.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.233
This page lets you quickly review event notifications from your managed customers. 
In the main CUSTOMER PORTAL 

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:48.066
NOTIFICATIONS area, you can easily view the type of event, a brief description of the event, and which customers are impacted.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:56.399
If you click the notification icon, you’ll see important system events not specifically related to a managed customer.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.200
Here’s where you’ll find notifications about license errors, profile management, new customer additions, and more.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:17.066
You can configure these system notifications any time by going to the Settings menu, found under your profile icon in the top-right. 

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:22.666
Let’s move to the Customers page.
Here is where you’ll be able to add, delete, and manage your customers. 

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:28.999
To add a new or existing Knox customer to the Knox MSP Portal,
Click ADD CUSTOMER

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.466
If you have an existing Knox customer:
enter their Knox Customer ID in the search bar and click LOOK UP. Once the customer ID is 

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:45.999
identified, click REQUEST TO ADD.
An email is sent to the customer’s current administrator, informing them that a Knox MSP 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.766
would like to manage devices and services on behalf of the customer. 
Once they accept the invitation, the existing 

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:58.599
Knox customer will appear in your main Customer list. 
If you are creating an account for a new 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.466
customer:
fill out the Add customer form with the appropriate company and contact information.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:20.099
In the customer management type field, select Fully managed customer if you want to take full control of the customer’s devices and services,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.566
Or select Jointly managed customer if you want to allow the customer to manage their own devices and services along with you.

00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:32.999
In the SERVICES section, select the Knox cloud service that you want to manage for this customer. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.766
Once you are done with the form, click ADD CUSTOMER to complete the process.
To make changes to a managed customer – 

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:49.132
such as changing the company address, contact email, management type, or the services managed – or to delink the customer 

00:03:49.133 --> 00:04:02.699
from the Knox MSP portal, click the customer’s name then click MANAGE ACCOUNT.
If you want to stop managing a customer 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.133
account, you can initiate a DELINK request from the Knox MSP console. 
The customer will receive a DELINK request 

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:16.666
email, and must accept the request for the action to take effect. 
Once the DELINK is complete, you will no 

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:23.132
longer be able to access any of the customer’s data or services.  
Note that the DELINK feature only works for 

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:30.399
jointly-managed customers. If you are fully managing a customer, you’ll need to first change your management type on this page to 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.200
Jointly managed.
Let’s move over to the Devices page. 
Here you can control which devices go to which 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.300
fully managed customers, without having to rely on Resellers to match up the correct IMEI numbers with the corresponding Customers. 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:54.266
As a Knox MSP, you can simply ask your resellers to upload all devices to your portal, then you can easily move devices between 

00:04:54.266 --> 00:05:01.632
customers as you see fit. 
To do this, first provide your MSP ID to your reseller. If your reseller uploads any devices 

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:08.766
using this MSP ID, you’ll find them in the UPLOADS tab. 
For any pending uploads in the list, click View 

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:17.999
then click APPROVE ALL DEVICES. These devices will move to the main pool in the DEVICES tab. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.100
From the main devices list, select the ones that you want to move to your customer, then go to ACTIONS and select Move devices to 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.000
customer. 
In the pop-up window, select the fully managed customer that you want to move the devices to, 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.600
then click CONFIRM.
The devices will now be available on the customer’s Knox Admin portal.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:47.033
Let’s switch over to the Licenses page. 
As a Knox MSP, you can purchase licenses for the various Knox cloud services that you're 

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:54.566
going to manage on behalf of a customer. 
The way licenses are managed by an Knox MSP differs slightly depending on the customer 

00:05:54.566 --> 00:06:00.232
type:
When you have fully-managed customers, you take full control of their devices, services, and 

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:07.599
licenses. Any Knox cloud service licenses that you purchase are yours to assign and distribute to these customers as you see fit. 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.766
This means you can share a single license key between multiple fully-managed customers if enough seats are available. 

00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:21.966
When you have a jointly managed customer, you and your customer both have control over devices and services. However, when it comes 

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:29.466
to licenses, you can only purchase or assign licenses from the customer’s service portal, and not from the MSP portal directly.  

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:36.566
To obtain a license for your fully-managed customers, go to ACTIONS then select Get a license from the drop-down menu. 

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:44.066
From the trial license list, select the services you want a license for, then click GENERATE TRIAL LICENSE. 

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:52.632
With a trial license, you can enroll up to 30 devices in any Knox cloud service for up to 3 months. This lets you test out a service and 

00:06:52.633 --> 00:07:02.199
fully utilize its features and capabilities before committing to a full commercial license. 
Once the trial license is generated, it’ll appear 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.766
in the list within the FULLY MANAGED CUSTOMERS tab. 
To assign the license to one or more fully-

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:19.066
managed customers, click the license name, then click ASSIGN TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER. Moving over to the Profiles page.

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:26.532
As an MSP, you may want to use the same device configuration for many of your managed customers, especially if they have the same 

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:33.266
device models and use the same Knox cloud services.
Rather than manually creating the exact same 

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:41.399
Knox Configure profile for each managed customer, you can instead copy one or more profiles from one or more customers, and apply 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.933
it to multiple other customers with just a few simple clicks. 
To do this, go to the COPYABLE PROFILES 

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:59.233
tab, select the profile from the list, then click ACTIONS &gt; Copy to customer(s). 
In the next page, select the customer names 

00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:12.599
that you want to copy the profiles to, then click NEXT, then click CREATE PROFILES to confirm. 

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:21.000
Back on the KNOX CONFIGURE PROFILES tab, you can find the profiles you just copied, as well as every other profile created in your 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.066
customer’s Knox Configure console.
This concludes our walkthrough for getting started on the Knox MSP Portal. 

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:36.866
As an official Samsung Knox Managed Service Provider, you now have access to tools and features to help add value to your service 

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:43.832
