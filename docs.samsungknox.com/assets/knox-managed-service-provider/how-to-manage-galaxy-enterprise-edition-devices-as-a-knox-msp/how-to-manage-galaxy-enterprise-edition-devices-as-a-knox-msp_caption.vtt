00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900
Welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.366
In this video, we’ll show you how to get started with managing Galaxy Enterprise Edition devices in the Knox MSP Portal. 

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.932
Let’s get started 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.700
As an official Samsung Knox Managed Service Provider, 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.800
you can easily manage your customer’s Enterprise Edition devices from a single, easy to use console. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.400
Before you can get started with managing Enterprise Edition devices in the Knox MSP Portal, 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.266
you’ll need to enroll in the Knox Partner Program as a Managed Service Provider.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:53.166
You’ll then need to have Galaxy Enterprise Edition devices purchased and uploaded to your customer’s accounts. 

00:00:53.566 --> 00:01:02.532
After you’ve been approved for enrollment for the Knox Partner Program, sign in and launch the Knox MSP Portal. 

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:08.366
When you launch the Knox MSP Portal, you’ll land on the notifications dashboard. 

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:15.599
Here you’ll receive important notifications related to your managed customers’ devices, services, and licenses. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.733
To start managing Enterprise Edition devices, we’ll need to first have a customer in the Knox MSP Portal. 

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:27.533
Select Customers from the left menu, then click ADD CUSTOMER. 

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:34.366
If you are managing an existing Knox customer, you can enter their Customer ID in the field on the right. 

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:40.999
In this demo, we’ll be adding a brand new jointly-managed customer to the Knox MSP Portal.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:56.232
After we fill out the CUSTOMER INFORMATION form and create the new customer, 

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:01.799
we’ll then need to ensure that the customer gets Enterprise Edition devices added to their account. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.233
As mentioned in the requirements, you’ll need EE devices purchased and uploaded to your customer’s account. 

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:17.333
If you are jointly managing your customers, have them provide their Customer IDs to their EE device reseller. 

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:21.733
The reseller will upload the devices directly to the customer’s account. 

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:28.333
If you are fully managing your customers, then you’ll need to provide your MSP ID to your resellers 

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:34.333
so that they can upload the Enterprise Edition devices directly to your Knox MSP Portal. 

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:38.899
Once Enterprise Edition devices have been uploaded to the customer’s account, 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.700
you’ll be able to generate Knox Suite licenses for the Enterprise Edition devices. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.100
To do this, go to Licenses in the left navigation menu, then click MANAGE KNOX SUITE ENTERPRISE EDITION LICENSE.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.433
In the pop-up, select the customer with Enterprise Edition devices from the list. 

00:02:56.433 --> 00:03:01.366
Click CONFIRM to generate an Enterprise Edition license for this customer. 

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:08.099
After you accept the Samsung Knox terms of use, you’ll be taken to the Enterprise Edition dashboard page. 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.300
Select the device reseller that uploaded the Enterprise Edition devices, then click GENERATE LICENSE. 

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:24.366
In the pop-up, select whether you want to Append to an existing license key or Generate a new license key. 

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:27.332
Enter an optional license start date, then click GENERATE.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:35.033
To return to the License page, click the arrow in the top-left corner of the screen. 

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:40.199
Back on the Licenses page, you’ll see a list of all licenses, current and expired.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.566
From here, you can manage the services that your customers have access to by clicking a service in the CUSTOMERS column.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:51.999
For example, if we wanted to launch and manage Knox E-FOTA for our customer, 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.933
we’d simply click the Knox E-FOTA link to launch that service’s console. 

00:03:56.933 --> 00:04:01.599
After the console launches, we’ll be able create campaigns and apply important updates 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.766
to the customer’s devices without ever leaving the Knox MSP portal. 

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:12.899
This concludes our tour on getting started with Enterprise Edition devices on the Knox MSP Portal. 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.833
