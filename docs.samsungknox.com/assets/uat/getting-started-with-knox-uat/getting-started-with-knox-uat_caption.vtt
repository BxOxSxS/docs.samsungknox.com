00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:12.955
Hello and welcome to this Samsung Knox training video on getting started with Knox UAT.

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:22.844
Knox UAT – or User Acceptance Testing – is an opportunity for existing customers to try out new and updated Knox features

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:29.065
in an isolated pre-production environment, two weeks prior to the production release date.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:37.478
By participating in Knox UAT, customers can get familiar with upcoming features, test the compatibility&nbsp;of 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:42.012
new features on existing devices, and report issues&nbsp;or bugs

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:46.545
related to new features so that they can be resolved ahead of the release date.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:56.343
Knox UAT is available for most of the Knox services. However, the following products and services are not supported:

00:00:56.344 --> 00:01:03.340
Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Capture, and Samsung Care+ for Business.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.671
Before you can sign up for Knox UAT, you’ll need to ensure that your devices meet the following requirements:

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:17.066
They are in the supported devices list for your service, and they are running the required Knox version. 

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:26.916
You can find a link to the supported devices list by going to samsungknox.com and selecting Solutions &gt; Knox devices. 

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:35.185
On the Devices Secured by Knox page, select the service you want to use, then find your devices from the list.

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:45.065
For most services, you’ll need devices running Android 13 OS or higher, in order to support auto-enrollment into your UAT environment. 
 

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:53.729
For Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA, and Knox Asset Intelligence specifically, you can enroll a device running an older version of Android, 
 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.066
by using a manual enrollment method – provided that the device meets the minimum requirements for that particular service.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:05.573
If you are testing Knox Configure or Knox Mobile Enrollment,

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:10.832
you must have Android 13 OS or higher in order to use the UAT environment.

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:21.897
If you are testing devices with Knox Guard, your devices must be a Galaxy S23 or later, and running Android 13 OS or higher.

00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:31.814
And finally, if you’re testing a device in UAT, that device must not already be enrolled into any service in the production environment.

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:39.849
If your test device is already enrolled in a production environment, you’ll need to unenroll before using it for UAT.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.520
The UAT environment is completely separate from the production Samsung Knox environment.

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:53.065
As such, you’ll need to register for a UAT Knox account if you’re accessing the environment for the first time.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:03:02.683
To register for a UAT Knox account, first go to: uat-www.samsungknox.com then click Enroll. 

00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:10.288
Once you’re on the UAT registration page, provide a work email address and follow the registration instructions on screen.

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:14.730
After you create your Samsung account and fill out your company information,

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:18.790
you’ll need to wait for a Samsung admin to approve your registration.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:27.066
Once approved, log back in with your UAT credentials and select the services that you want to test during the UAT period.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.783
Once your services are enabled, you’ll then need to add your devices into each service.

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:43.456
Adding devices to the UAT environment is easy. You simply need to raise a UAT support ticket, provide your device IMEI numbers,

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:47.340
and the Samsung Knox support team will take care of upload.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:57.349
To create a UAT support ticket, go to the Knox Admin Portal help section in the upper-right corner, then click Submit/view support tickets.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.072
On the next page, click SUBMIT A SUPPORT TICKET. After you accept the privacy agreements,

00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:08.999
click SUBMIT, then on the support page, click Create a case.

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:20.221
In the case creation form, select Knox Mobile Enrollment as the product, enter your location, then click Next.

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:27.919
In step 2, in the subject line, enter [UAT] Device enrollment,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.033
then provide your device IMEI numbers in the Description field and click Finish to submit the ticket.

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:40.733
Your devices will be uploaded once the support team receives the ticket.

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:47.482
During UAT testing, if you discover any issues, you can report them with a UAT support ticket.

00:04:47.482 --> 00:04:56.025
Once issues are reported, the Samsung Knox team will actively review and prioritize critical issues before the end of the UAT period,

00:04:56.026 --> 00:05:02.031
to help minimize any impact to your services, features, and devices upon the production release date.

00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:09.519
To report an issue, go back to the help section in the Knox Admin Portal, then click Submit/view support tickets.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:17.635
Then on the support page, click Create a case. Then select the product that you need help with, enter your license key,

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:22.129
your location, the issue severity, then click Next.

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:29.121
Note that a Knox Suite license key is automatically generated when you register for the UAT environment. 

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:33.532
You can use this license key when creating the support ticket.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.678
In step 2, ensure that you enter [UAT] followed by the issue in the subject line.

00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:51.287
This will ensure that the issue is expedited and place in a higher priority so that it can be fixed ahead of the production release date.

00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:58.486
In the description field, provide an explanation of the issue and any relevant images, then click Finish. 

00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:06.499
On the support page, you can view the status of your UAT ticket by clicking Support in the navbar, then selecting Case.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.080
This concludes our video on getting started with Knox UAT.
