00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.300
With a Samsung account for Business, you can sign up for Knox cloud services without using your personal Samsung Account, allowing you

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.900
to keep your personal and enterprise accounts separate.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.700


5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.266
To get started, go to samsungknox.com. Here, you can get a 90-day trial of our services, through the Knox Suite – Enterprise Plan.

6
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:20.666


7
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:28.866
Now you can sign up for a Samsung account for Business. Before you start, make sure you have your company's DUNS or VAT number, and

8
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.132
the location of your company's main headquarters.

9
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:38.599
To create your account, enter your company name and country. You can also enter your company website for your account.

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.800
Then, fill in your profile information and login details, which you'll use to sign in to this account.

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.600


12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Complete email verification and two-step verification,

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.200


14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.633
and agree to the Terms and Conditions. You'll receive an email confirming that your account has been created.

15
00:00:58.633 --> 00:00:59.099


16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Now you can register your company to your new Samsung account for Business.

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.666
Fill in your company name and DUNS number. If you don't have a DUNS number, you can also register with your company's VAT number.

18
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.732


19
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.833
Now, enter your company information,

20
00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.766


21
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.366
and provide a contact for verification.

22
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.466


23
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.999
Then, submit your company registration.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.533


25
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:33.033
Next, you can make your Knox application, where you can enter your company's local address. If this address is the same as the one

26
00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:39.899
used for your Samsung account for Business, you can enable "Use the company address from Samsung account for Business for my

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.733
application".

28
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.633


29
00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:48.133
Finally, agree to the Samsung Knox terms and conditions to complete your application.  

30
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:52.433
We will notify you through email once your Knox application is approved.

31
00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:58.566
Once you receive your approvals, you can sign in to samsungknox.com with your new Samsung account for Business.

32
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:07.399


33
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.533
To invite admins, go to Administrators and Roles

34
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:12.933


35
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.833
and click INVITE ADMIN

36
00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.399


37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.800
Enter the name and email of your admin, and create a user ID for them.

38
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.900


39
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.933
Then you can assign them to a role. You can also create a role with specific permissions for different Knox cloud services.

40
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:32.566


41
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:40.299
Once you click "Invite", your invited admin appears with the pending status, and they will receive an email invite with a link to activate

42
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.833
their Samsung account for Business. This link is only valid for 7 days, and you can re-invite them from the Administrators and Roles page.

43
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.333


44
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.833
Your admin must complete registration within 30 days of account creation

45
00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:59.633
or their account will be deleted, and they will no longer appear on the Administrators and Roles page.

46
00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:00.666


47
00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:05.299
When your admin clicks the invite link, they must agree with the privacy notice

48
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.700
then they can review the admin information you set for them.

49
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.766
They must set up a password that they'll use to log in, and enter a phone number for two-step verification.

50
00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.999


51
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.200
They can now sign in and use Knox cloud services according to the permissions you've granted them.

52
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.366


53
00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:36.332
Once they're set up, you can go back to your Administrator and Roles page and verify that their status is now Active.

54
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:37.233


55
00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:41.899
You can also check this on the Samsung account for Business portal under Users.

56
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.300


57
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.466
