00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.483
As a Knox Suite customer, 

2
00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:08.011
you can seamlessly enroll your company’s devices into an EMM

3
00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:13.799
and several Knox cloud services at the same time, using the Knox Admin Portal's Enrollment feature.

4
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.766
Before you begin, you will need to ensure that you have the following: 

5
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.214
A valid Knox Suite license. 

6
00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:25.033
All customers will receive a Knox Suite - Enterprise Plan license when they first sign up for a Knox account.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.566
Check out our Getting started with Knox Suite video if you haven't already signed up for an account.

8
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:35.841
You’ll also need devices uploaded to your Knox account by a certified Knox reseller. 

9
00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.999
If you don't already have a reseller, 

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.799
go to the resellers page of samsungknox.com to find one for your region.

11
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:47.056
To get started, sign into your Knox Admin Portal, 

12
00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:50.436
then click Enrollment in the left navigation pane. 

13
00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:54.488
On the Enrollment profiles page, click Create profile. 

14
00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.087
On the next page, give your profile a name and description, 

15
00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:01.766
then select the services that you want to enroll your devices into.

16
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:08.499
The Enrollment profile lets you enroll devices into an EMM and Knox cloud services at the same time.

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.215
If you have an EMM, select EMM from the list.

18
00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:17.792
By default, the Knox Service Plugin agent will also be installed during the enrollment process.

19
00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:21.594
You can unselect this option if you don't want to install the agent.

20
00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:25.223
If you are using Knox cloud services like Knox E-FOTA

21
00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:29.313
or Knox Asset Intelligence, select the services from the list.

22
00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:32.699
Once you've made your selection, click Next.

23
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.215
Enter your EMM info, then on the following page,

24
00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:40.347
configure your EMM enrollment settings. For most EMMs, 

25
00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:46.054
you can use the DPC extras feature to pre-configure your devices with EMM-specific settings.

26
00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:52.699
For example, if you want to force your devices to be configured as fully-managed devices during the enrollment process,

27
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.966
you can add this parameter here.

28
00:01:55.233 --> 00:02:00.966
Refer to your EMM's documentation to learn which Device Policy Controller (DPC) options are available.

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.677
Refer to your EMM's documentation to learn which Device Policy Controller (DPC) options are available.

30
00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:07.799
Apply any other EMM settings are required, then click Next to review your enrollment profile.

31
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.433
Once confirmed, click Create and assign.

32
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:16.074
On the next page, select the devices that you want to associate this profile with, 

33
00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:18.053
then click Assign to devices. 

34
00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:22.479
On the Enrollment profiles page, you'll see a list of every profile created,

35
00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.999
along with the EMM name, Knox services, and profile status.

36
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.853
After your profile is assigned, 

37
00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:34.113
your end users simply need to turn on their new or factory reset devices,

38
00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:38.537
connect to a Wi-Fi or data network, and go through the device set up screens. 

39
00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:44.775
Once set up, the devices will automatically begin enrolling into your EMM and Knox cloud services,

40
00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:48.287
without requiring the user to download any additional apps, 

41
00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:50.661
or configure any additional settings.

42
00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:55.932
This process of setting up the device and having it automatically enroll into a service or EMM

43
00:02:55.933 --> 00:03:00.933
is also known as OOBE (out of box experience) enrollment.

44
00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:03.282
After the device is enrolled, 

45
00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:07.233
the Devices page will update to show that the enrollment was successful.

46
00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:13.527
When you add new devices to your fleet, you can simply assign the same enrollment profiles to those devices,

47
00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:18.933
or create a new profile if you want to select a different EMM, or use different Knox services.

48
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:23.155
If you no longer want to associate a device with an Enrollment profile, 

49
00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:29.932
select the device from the Devices page, then click Actions, then Unassign enrollment profile. 

50
00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.779
If you want to change an existing device’s profile, 

51
00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:39.832
click Actions, Assign enrollment profile, then select the new profile and click Assign.

52
00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:47.268
This concludes our video on how to enroll Galaxy devices into an EMM and multiple Knox services.
