00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:06.735
As a Samsung Knox customer, you’ll need devices added to your account 

2
00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:09.899
before you can begin using any Knox cloud service.

3
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:15.866
To add devices, simply purchase them from a Samsung approved reseller in your region. 

4
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.733
After your reseller uploads devices to your account for the first time, 

5
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.510
you’ll need to approve the devices in each service respectively.

6
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.488
To do this, log into your Knox Admin Portal, select a service

7
00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:33.235
(for example Knox Mobile Enrollment), then go to the Devices page.

8
00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:38.594
On the UPLOADS tab, you’ll see a list of resellers that have uploaded devices to your account. 

9
00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:43.760
If you have newly uploaded devices, the UPLOAD APPROVAL column will show Pending.

10
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:49.466
In the DETAILS column, click View to review the list of devices included in this upload.

11
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.899
Click APPROVE ALL DEVICES.

12
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
Then on the pop up window, click Approve

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.233
to add these devices to your service.

14
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.706
Once the reseller upload is approved for that service, 

15
00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:03.590
you have the option to either set reseller preferences, 

16
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.536
or continue approving devices for your other Knox cloud services.

17
00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:13.799
In our example, we'll click Back to uploads to continue approving devices for our other Knox services.

18
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:23.333
Once device uploads are approved in each service for the first time, 

19
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.233
you can go to the Resellers page to manage your reseller preferences. 

20
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.553
Click the name of your reseller, then on the next page

21
00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:34.399
select Automatically add future uploads from this reseller.

22
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:39.558
With this option enabled, each time your resellers add new devices to your account, 

23
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.944
the devices are automatically approved. 

24
00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:46.732
This eliminates the need to review and approve new uploads for each service manually.

25
00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:54.252
Once you've set your reseller preferences, click Save.

26
00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:57.753
Back on the Resellers page, you'll see your Knox services,

27
00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.366
along with the device auto-approval status for each service.

28
00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:08.189
This concludes our video on how to approve reseller uploads and set reseller preferences.

29
00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:15.032
