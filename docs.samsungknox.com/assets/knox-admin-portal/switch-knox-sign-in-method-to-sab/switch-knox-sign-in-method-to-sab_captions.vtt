00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:04.899
You can now sign-in to Knox cloud services with a Samsung account for Business

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.566
instead of your personal Samsung account, allowing you to keep your personal and enterprise accounts separate.

3
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.232
As the super admin of a Samsung Knox account,

4
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:19.366
you can switch the sign-in method of your Knox account and the accounts of your sub-admins to Samsung account for Business.

5
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.333
To begin the transition,

6
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:28.533
sign in to your Knox Admin Portal and click “Get started” on the new banner to Switch your sign-in method to Samsung account for Business.

7
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.699
Start by signing up for a Samsung account for Business.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.333
Fill in your account information,

9
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.232
then complete email and two-step verification.

10
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.366
Once your account has been created,

11
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.999
you can register your company with your company name and DUNS number.

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.600
If you don’t have a DUNS number, you can enter a valid VAT or business registration number.

13
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.166
Review your company information and provide a contact for verification.

14
00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:01.699
After you submit your company registration for Samsung account for Business,

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.166
you can continue using Knox services with your personal Samsung account while your registration is reviewed.

16
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.999
Once your company registration is verified,

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.800
you can continue switching your Knox sign-in method to Samsung account for Business from your Knox Admin Portal.

18
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.800
To continue the transition, you must set Samsung account for Business "Account IDs" for your sub admins.

19
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.200
When the transition is complete, Your sub admins will use this new account ID to sign in to Samsung Knox.

20
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.500
By default, Samsung account for Business account IDs end with “account.samsung.com”.

21
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.266
If you already have verified domains on Samsung account for Business,

22
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:47.466
you can set your sub-admins’ new account IDs to use one of the verified domains from the dropdown.

23
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.766
Note that the same ID cannot be in use on both Samsung account for Business and a personal Samsung account at the same time.

24
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:04.099
If this happens, your sub admin’s ID validation status will be set to “Taken by Samsung account”.

25
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.300
If you want your sub admins to continue using the same ID as before on Samsung account for Business,

26
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.833
simply move forward with the “Switch sign-in method” process.

27
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.666
When the process is complete,

28
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:22.399
your sub-admin will receive an email notification prompting them to change the email address of their personal Samsung account.

29
00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:28.866
After they make the change, they can activate the new Samsung account for Business ID you set for them.

30
00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:38.666
If the Account ID validation shows “Can be created”, moving forward with the “Switch sign-in method” process sends those sub-admins an 

31
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:42.832
email with instructions to activate their new Samsung account for Business ID.

32
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:47.666
Some sub-admins might also show “Mapped to existing account”,

33
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:54.832
which means that this admin already has a Samsung account for Business ID that matches the new ID you’re about to assign them.

34
00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.866
When you move forward with the “Switch sign-in method” process, 

35
00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:02.599
those admins will sign in to Knox with their existing Samsung account for Business ID.

36
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:10.699
Once you’re ready, click “Switch sign-in method”. This step is irreversible, so make sure you’re ready before you proceed.

37
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.166
You can now select a new account ID for yourself.

38
00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:19.199
If you have multiple verified domains on Samsung account for Business,

39
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.533
you can choose which domain to use for your new account ID.

40
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.899
If you select an account ID that’s already being used by your personal Samsung account

41
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.566
you’ll be taken to your personal Samsung account to change your email ID

42
00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:34.266
so you can use that ID for Samsung account for Business instead.

43
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:40.033
You've successfully switched your sign-in method to Samsung account for Business! 

44
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:44.533
From now on, you can sign in to your Knox account with your new account ID.

45
00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:51.199
You can go to the admin list to see whether your sub-admins have successfully transitioned their sign-in to Samsung account for Business

46
00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:58.532
 Your organization might be maintaining multiple Samsung Knox accounts,

47
00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:02.333
each managed by a super admin in separate locations

48
00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:03.866
Let's call them Alice and Bob!

49
00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:10.266
In Samsung account for Business your company registration represents your whole organization,

50
00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.599
tied to your company’s DUNS number.

51
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.666
When Alice signs up for Samsung account for Business and registers your company's DUNS number,

52
00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:21.666
she becomes an admin on your organization’s Samsung account for Business.

53
00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:27.066
When Bob tries to perform company registration with your company’s DUNS number,

54
00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.666
he will find that it's already in use from Alice's registration.

55
00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:38.032
Here, Bob can request Alice to add him to your organization’s Samsung account for Business as an admin or location manager.

56
00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:43.399
Once he's added, he'll receive an email to activate his Samsung account for Business account ID.

57
00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:51.066
Bob can now sign in to his Knox Admin Portal to switch the sign-in method of his Knox account!

58
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.333
In step 1 of the process,

59
00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:57.233
he should sign in to Samsung account for Business with his new account ID,

60
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.266
then proceed with the rest of the process to complete the transition.

61
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.900
When Bob completes the transition

62
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.266
his Knox account is listed as a Service Location on the Samsung account for Business console.
