00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:11.440
Hello and welcome to this Samsung Knox training video on Getting started with the Knox Admin portal.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.770
In this video, we'll explain what the Knox Admin Portal is and give you a short tour,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.083
as well as demonstrate how to manage licenses, roles, and administrators.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:24.273
So, if you're new to the world of Samsung Knox, and you're excited to start using Knox cloud services,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.832
then this video is for you. Let's get started!

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:29.679
The Knox Admin Portal lets Samsung Knox customers manage 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.332
all of their devices and services from a single, integrated web application.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.645
It was designed to provide a "single pane of glass" experience by allowing users to seamlessly

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:41.332
manage different Knox cloud services of their choice without having to ever leave the portal.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.333
Let’s get started by signing in. 

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.926
Go to samsungknox.com and click Sign in with Samsung Account.

00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:53.499
Note that you’ll need a registered and approved Samsung Knox account to use the Knox Admin Portal.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.140
Enter your Samsung account email address and click Next.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.899
Then, type your password and click Sign in.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.400
Once you sign in, you’ll be taken to the Knox Admin Portal dashboard.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.266
If it’s your first time signing in, select the services you’re interested in using.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.237
Let's take a quick look at some of the key features of the Knox Admin Portal.

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:15.326
When you sign in for the first time, you’re taken to the Dashboard.

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:20.632
Here, you can view Knox notifications, device alerts, and any open support tickets.

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:25.765
The Get started pane lists the four basic steps to follow to set up the Knox Admin Portal.

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:30.097
Each step includes a link to the relevant Knox Admin Portal page or admin guide article.

00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:35.832
This is a great place to start for brand new users who want to learn about Samsung Knox’s capabilities and features.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:40.808
From the left navigation pane, you can easily access your Knox cloud services and begin managing your

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:44.033
enterprise devices and licenses with just a few simple clicks. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.359
Using the search bar at the top of the screen, 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.896
you can search for existing devices by their exact IMEI or serial number.

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:55.541
Note that this search bar is available from every page in the Knox Admin Portal, 

00:01:55.541 --> 00:02:00.357
and that changes made to devices from here will affect the device across services.

00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:02.997
In the Notifications pane, 

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:08.205
you can view important information such as license expiry alerts or new device upload information.

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:13.099
In the Device alerts pane, you can see any device error information which requires admin attention.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.666
New users will see links to learn how to add and enroll devices.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.200
In the Open support tickets pane, you can see any of your active support tickets.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.700
If you don’t have any, you can click Submit a ticket to reach out to Samsung Knox support.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.866
Under Quick links, you can add up links to up to six pages to make them easily accessible from the dashboard.

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:41.366
The Knox Highlights pane showcases new and updated products and features.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.266
Under Active licenses, you can view all of your organization’s active Knox licenses.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.766
If you don’t have any licenses, you can click the link to Get a Knox license key or learn how to purchase licenses.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:58.434
In the top right corner, you can click the help icon to get access to valuable customer support resources and Knox

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:03.666
admin documentation as well as check the current status and version of your Knox services.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:07.598
Simply expand the Documentation menu to quickly jump to the release notes, 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.133
how-to videos, or admin guides for any of your Knox cloud services.&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.630
Also in the top right corner is the account icon, 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.932
which you can click to see your account information and open the Knox Admin Portal Settings screen.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.332
Here, you can set your default landing page preference and select 

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:27.617
which Knox cloud services you want to see in the navigation pane.

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:32.733
Click Default Landing Page to choose which page you want to see when you first sign in to the Knox Admin Portal.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.723
By default, you'll see the dashboard, 

00:03:34.723 --> 00:03:38.332
but this can be changed to display the dashboard of your most commonly used service.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:44.114
Click Show/Hide services if you want to add or remove services in the Knox Admin Portal. 

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:47.666
Select the services you want to add or remove, then click Confirm. 

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:51.125
Note that you won’t be able to access hidden services, 

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:55.043
but your data will be saved and you can always choose to show the service again in the future.

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:59.532
As a sub-admin, you can only select or unselect services that you have been invited to.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.766
Any services you add will appear in the left navigation menu.

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:07.707
Click Email Preferences to choose which emails you want to receive from the 

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:10.999
Knox Admin Portal as well as each of your Knox services.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:14.618
Let’s get into some of the key features of the Knox Admin Portal. 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.399
First, we’ll walk through how to manage licenses.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.758
The Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Licenses page

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:24.051
that shows all of your Knox Cloud Service license keys on one page. 

00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:28.230
To get to the Licenses page, click Licenses in the navigation pane.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.619
All of your company’s licenses are visible in the Licenses table. 

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:35.817
By default, brand new users will see a Knox Suite trial license auto-generated

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:38.436
You can sort licenses by their name and number of seats

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:41.332
 as well as filter licenses by their type and status.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.033
You can also search for licenses by their name or their license key.

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:47.499
To add a new license, click Actions. 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.066
If you don’t have an existing license key, click Get a license.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:56.403
If you’re just planning on doing some development or testing using your license key, 

00:04:56.404 --> 00:05:01.499
you can generate a free trial license that’s valid for 3 months and can support up to 30 devices.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.300
Select the type of trial license you need, then click Generate trial license.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.987
If you need a commercial license, 

00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:11.481
click Find reseller to open a list of Knox resellers in your 

00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:14.132
region who you can purchase a commercial license from.

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:18.514
If you are an Enterprise Edition customer, click Generate Knox Suite license 

00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.699
to open the Enterprise Edition license dashboard.

00:05:21.933 --> 00:05:24.759
Here, you can manage Enterprise Edition license keys 
 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.712
and view how many devices are associated with each license.

00:05:27.713 --> 00:05:29.964
Make sure your reseller has uploaded your Enterprise 

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:32.499
Edition devices to your account beforehand

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.149
Once you’ve purchased a commercial license key from your reseller, 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.845
you can enter the license key in the Knox Admin Portal to apply it to your account.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:41.575
Just click Enter license key, 

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:44.166
then enter a license name and a valid license key.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.491
If you've obtained a new Knox license with additional seats, you may want to replace your existing license with it. 

00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:55.298
This feature is only available for Knox Suite, Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA, 

00:05:55.298 --> 00:05:58.612
Knox Configure, and Knox Asset Intelligence licenses.

00:05:58.613 --> 00:06:02.833
First, select the license you want to replace, then click Replace license.

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:08.832
On the Select license screen, you can see a list of active licenses available for replacement. 

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:13.433
Select one to replace your current one with, then click Done.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.466
If you’re using Samsung Care+ for Business, you can assign devices to your license by clicking Assign a license.

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:25.673
The Knox Admin Portal also offers a consolidated Administrators &amp; Roles page 

00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:30.099
that allows you to create and manage administrators and roles for all of your Knox cloud services.

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:32.699
Let’s start by going over Roles. 

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:36.414
Roles allow you to define custom permissions for admins,

00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:39.666
for individual services, or for all of your Knox cloud services.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.916
You can sort roles by name or filter them by service, 

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:45.466
as well as search for roles by name using the search bar.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.566
To create a custom role, click&nbsp;CREATE ROLE. 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.500
Next, choose a Knox service for the role and give the role a name and optional description.

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:57.036
Depending on which service you’ve selected, 

00:06:57.037 --> 00:07:00.266
you’ll be able to choose from various permissions that the role will grant.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:04.066
When you're finished, click&nbsp;SAVE&nbsp;to create the role.

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.499
Next, let’s take a look at administrators.

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:15.933
All of your company’s Knox Cloud administrators can be viewed on the Administrators tab. 
 

00:07:16.133 --> 00:07:19.033
Administrators can be filtered by their role for each service. 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.766
You can also search for administrators by name or email address.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.049
If you want to invite a new admin, click Invite administrator. 

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:32.066
Next, enter the administrator’s first and last name and email address. 

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:37.871
Finally, select the services you want them to have access to, and for each service, select a role.

00:07:37.872 --> 00:07:42.140
If there aren’t any roles available for that service, click Create a role to make one.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.724
Once you select a role, you can view its permissions in detail by clicking View Role Details.

00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:48.513
When you’re done, click Invite. 

00:07:48.514 --> 00:07:51.632
An invitation will be sent to the administrator’s email address.

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:56.385
This concludes our video on Getting started with the Knox Admin Portal.&nbsp;

00:07:56.385 --> 00:08:01.665
