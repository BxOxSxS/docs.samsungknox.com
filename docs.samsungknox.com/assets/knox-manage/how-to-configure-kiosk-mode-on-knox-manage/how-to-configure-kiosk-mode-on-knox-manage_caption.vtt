00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.130
Welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:08.197
In this video, we’ll show you how to configure the Knox Manage kiosk profile.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.330
A 'kiosk' is a mobile device pre-configured to provide a customized 

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:23.397
and controlled experience for users and customers. 

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:25.797
With Knox Manage,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.830
IT admins can easily create profiles that allow 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.663
devices to operate as either a single-app

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.497
or a multi-app kiosk,

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:37.563
and quickly deploy to devices in the fleet.

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:39.430
So, if you’re ready to learn about 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.963
this great feature, let’s get started.

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:45.264
Before you begin, you will need:

00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:47.964
An account at samsungknox.com.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.230
Access to the Knox Manage console, and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.230
One or more devices in your fleet that can be deployed as a kiosk

00:00:55.997 --> 00:00:57.263
Once you’re ready to begin, 

00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:00.197
sign into your account at samsungknox.com

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:07.397
Locate the Knox Manage widget and click Launch console. 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.996
This will take you to the Knox Manage console.

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:16.497
 Let’s create a new configuration by selecting Kiosk

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:20.497
from the left navigation menu, then clicking Add. 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.663
With Knox Manage, you can create

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:25.664
two types of kiosk configurations.

00:01:26.097 --> 00:01:27.930
A Multi App Kiosk lets you 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.896
configure a device with more than one application,

00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:32.363
 and can be customized 

00:01:32.364 --> 00:01:35.197
with branding-specific wallpapers and colors.

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:37.597
A Single App Kiosk provides a much simpler

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.897
configuration where only one application

00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:41.330
can be launched 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.663
from the device’s home screen. 

00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:46.197
Let’s start with creating a Multi App Kiosk. 

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:49.463
then select Multi App Kiosk and click OK.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.830
This opens the Kiosk wizard.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.230
First, enter a name for your Multi App Kiosk

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.363
and verify that the package name has been set.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.930
Next, configure the appearance of the kiosk

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.130
by choosing the device’s orientation and grid, 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.130
and changing optional advanced settings like the background wallpaper,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.896
screen composition, and more. 

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:11.230
In our example, we’ll go to Advanced Settings to ensure 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.596
that the status bar is displayed. 

00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:18.297
If we want kiosk users to be able to access common device settings

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:22.297
like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Airplane Mode,

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:27.530
enable these in the Advanced Settings Device Settings pop-up. 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.496
Let’s now add a few apps to our kiosk

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:36.363
by simply dragging and dropping the app icons 

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.030
to the preview area. 

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:41.063
Once you’ve added the necessary apps and configured

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:42.897
the kiosk to your liking.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.730
click Save then OK

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.963
It may take a moment for Knox Manage to build the kiosk configuration. 

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:02.997
Once complete, the configuration will appear in the kiosk list. 

00:03:03.564 --> 00:03:07.564
When you’re ready to deploy the kiosk configuration to your enrolled devices,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.830
 select Profile from the left navigation menu.

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:13.163
On the profile page, click Add

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:17.164
then give your new profile a name and select the device platform. 

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:21.164
Click Save &amp; Set Policy to continue.

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:27.063
On the Set Policy page, select Kiosk in the Android Enterprise sub menu. 

00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:31.597
In the Kiosk App Settings field, select the type of kiosk

00:03:31.597 --> 00:03:33.963
that you want to deploy to your devices.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:37.964
Since we just created a multi app kiosk, we’ll select that here. 

00:03:38.397 --> 00:03:41.697
We’ll then need to add the kiosk configuration we just created.

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:47.130
In Set Application, click Add and select your kiosk from the list. 

00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:50.330
After you select your kiosk configuration,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
proceed with additional policy settings like whether

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.363
you want users to access utilities, 

00:03:56.364 --> 00:04:00.364
or whether you want the screen to turn on automatically when the device is plugged in. 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.563
If you want the kiosk configuration to be deleted from the device once

00:04:04.564 --> 00:04:07.230
the policy gets removed Knox Manage,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.696
then allow this option here. 

00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:14.863
When you’re finished with setting the policy, click Save &amp; Assign, then OK.

00:04:15.597 --> 00:04:19.597
Under the Group tab, select the target group to assign the profile to,

00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:22.963
 then click Assign &amp; Apply. 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.230
A confirmation window appears with a summary of your profile. 

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:45.130
Let’s now create a Single App Kiosk. 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.930
Rather than navigate back to the Kiosk page

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.330
you can alternately create a kiosk configuration while creating a new profile.

00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:56.664
From the Profile menu, click Add, then enter the profile name,

00:04:56.664 --> 00:05:00.664
select the platform, then click Save &amp; Set Policy.

00:05:01.164 --> 00:05:04.130
Select Kiosk in the Android Enterprise sub menu,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.896
then select Single App in the Kiosk App Settings field.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.963
Next to Set Application, click Add New.

00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:16.964
This launches the Kiosk wizard in a pop up window. 

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:19.664
Give your single app kiosk configuration a name,

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:22.930
and make changes to the device settings as required. 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.930
Click OK to confirm to push the changes to your devices.

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.896
Locate the app that you want to add to the device,

00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:40.430
then drag and drop the app icon into the preview area. 

00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:44.163
Click Save, then OK to build the kiosk configuration

00:05:44.164 --> 00:05:46.430
and return to the Set Policy screen.

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:50.030
Proceed with additional kiosk policy settings as needed.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.296
When finished with the settings, Click Save &amp; Assign, then OK. 

00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:57.563
Under the Group tab

00:05:57.564 --> 00:06:01.564
select the target group to assign the profile to, then click Assign &amp; Apply. 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.130
A confirmation window appears with a summary of your profile. 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.596
Click OK to confirm, to push the changes to your devices.

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:20.064
Once a device receives a kiosk profile,

00:06:20.064 --> 00:06:25.397
it continues to operate in kiosk mode until either an administrator removes the policy,

00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:29.397
or a kiosk “escape” is initiated from the device.

00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:32.564
If the device needs to exit out of kiosk mode,

00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:35.097
and a server connection is unavailable, 

00:06:35.097 --> 00:06:41.263
an end-user or local administrator can exit the kiosk by tapping the information icon

00:06:41.264 --> 00:06:45.430
and selecting Exit Kiosk on the About Kiosk screen. 

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:50.730
The user will be prompted to enter an Exit Kiosk Code,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.730
which can be obtained from the Knox Manage console. 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.130
 To obtain the code, navigate to Device on the Knox Manage console,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.130
then select the relevant Device Name from the list. 

00:07:04.197 --> 00:07:10.763
In the Security tab, locate Kiosk Mode Status and find the Exit Kiosk Code. 

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:15.597
Once the code is entered in the device, the kiosk is removed. 

00:07:15.997 --> 00:07:18.630
To re-enter kiosk mode on the device, 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.630
the IT admin must re-apply the kiosk profile using Knox Manage.

00:07:23.764 --> 00:07:27.764
This concludes our walkthrough of how to configure kiosk profiles 

00:07:27.764 --> 00:07:30.730
and apply them to devices using Knox Manage. 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.163
Once your kiosk devices are fully deployed in the field,

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:37.897
IT admins can provide end-users with live support

00:07:37.897 --> 00:07:41.130
and troubleshooting using our Knox Remote Support features.

00:07:41.364 --> 00:07:45.630
We’ll provide a link to another training video about this great feature at the end of this video.
