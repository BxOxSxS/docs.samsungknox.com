00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.633
Welcome to the Knox video training series.
In this video, we’ll show you how to create and apply Event Profile using Knox Manage.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:16.899
Let’s get started

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:24.899
It is impossible for IT admins to configure management policies that can fit for all cases by one normal profile,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.433
as each user's environment and situation is different. Knox Manage solves this problem by Event Profile that can intelligently apply 

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:39.299
dynamic policies to devices according to specific situations, which can minimize manual work for IT admins. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.100
Profiles can be configured with specific events for them, such as day and time, network environment such as Wi-Fi SSID 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.800
or roaming status, or location. The policies in these profiles are applied only when the chosen conditions are met. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.200
In this video, we will demonstrate how IT admin can set a time limit to disable a browser app for example during the weekends,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.933
while allowing to use during the weekdays, for working hours.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:13.866
Before you begin, you will need to:
• Create a Samsung account
• Register and activate Knox Manage tenant

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.266
• Inside Knox Manage:

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:21.599
Activate license,
•  Create an user and assign it to a group
•  Enroll Android Enterprise device

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:27.066
Once you’re ready to begin, sign into your account at samsungknox.com.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:38.499
Click Knox Manage on the left side of the screen to launch the console.
This will take you to the Knox Manage Dashboard.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.833
In the left navigation, select Profile. Here you can add, copy, apply, modify or delete your profiles.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:55.266
To create an Event Profile, let’s start by adding a new profile. Select Add.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:08.466
In the menu that shows up, type Profile name, select Platform and toggle Event Profile button to create an event.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.066
Note that you can only enable events when adding a new profile. If you want to add events for a profile that already exists, 

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:23.599
you need to add a new profile that includes the same options as the existing profile, and the events.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.333
From the Event Type pick "Day and Time“, 

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.433
select time zone, 

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.466
day/s, and the time period. 

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.832
This can be set even in multiple combinations.

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:48.866
Plus, “Allow Run Offline” will allow the event profile to work even when the device is offline.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:55.933
After filling out conditions click Save &amp; set policy.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:03:01.633
In this video, we will show how to block an app only during the weekends, for example.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:07.533
To do so, there needs to be a pair of Event Profiles to turn both on and off; 

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:15.333
one for the event on to block the app during weekends, and another for the event off to allow it back again during weekdays.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:21.633
To set your event on profile, pick an app and the group of devices or users you’d like to assign it to, 

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:28.966
add them to the App Execution Blocklist Setting in the application submenu and add it by clicking Apply, and Add.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:34.366
Then click OK and then save &amp; assign.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.366
Don’t miss out on configuring a policy for event “off” as well.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:57.466
During the day on Friday, it worked, whereas now it does not launch the app.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:04.832
As you can see on the device with a set time limit, the selected apps can’t be accessed outside of chosen time window.

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:09.266
As time goes by, you can use the app again when coming Monday morning, 

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:16.899
while on control group devices they’re available without any time constraints, meaning that the users can use any app at any time.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.933
Time events are especially good for schools and office work cases. It prevents students and employees from accessing certain apps when they shouldn’t.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.400
How practical! It can be above your expectation.

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:36.899
When it comes to a network environment use case, you may create an event profile with a certain Wi-Fi SSID so that mobile devices are applied

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.433
with specific policies when connected to the company Wi-Fi—not being able to browse YouTube on the company network, for example.

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:48.566
This concludes our tour on creating and applying Event Profile using Knox Manage.

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:57.966
