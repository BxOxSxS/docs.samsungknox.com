00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.466
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:16.132
In this video, we'll show you how to set-up Knox Manage on wearable devices.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.000
When enterprise organizations purchase and distribute Wear OS devices for business purposes, 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900
they set up their smartwatches in Pair and Detach mode.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.033
This mode involves an IT admin using a single Samsung Galaxy phone running the Galaxy Wearable Manager for Enterprise app 

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.833
to set up multiple watches. 

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:38.299
Once the watches are set up by the IT admin, they are automatically detached from the phone, 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.100
meaning they will only operate as standalone devices without a phone.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.833
Watches that are set up in this mode are managed and configured through Samsung Knox Manage.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.266
Let's jump right in.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.366
Before you proceed with this video, you'll need to have a valid Samsung Knox account and access to the Knox Manage service.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:02.932
You'll also need an available Knox license.
Finally, you’ll also need compatible devices. 

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:10.633
Please see the supported device list at Samsungknox.com for a complete list of devices supported by Knox Manage.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.299
To add a watch to Knox Manage, first ensure your Samsung Galaxy phone is prepared

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.700
to run the Galaxy Wearable Manager for Enterprise app. 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.933
To do this, download and install the following apps from Google Play:

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.699
Galaxy Wearable

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.900
Galaxy Wearable for Enterprise. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.800
Make sure these apps are at their latest versions.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.300
Once the apps are installed you'll need to create a device group and generate a Wear OS enrollment token. 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.066
This token will be used to provision your enterprise smartwatches.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.866
To generate the token:

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:48.266
Sign in to Knox Admin Portal and launch Knox Manage.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:02:01.566
Go to Group, then click Add.
On the Add Group page, create a new Device group.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:21.599
Once your Device group is created, go to Device Enrollment in the left navigation menu, then select Wear OS Token and click Add.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.066
Give the token a Name and Expiration Period, then select the device group to assign the token to.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.733
Click Save to return to the main list.

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:43.133
Click the name of the token you just created to open the Token Details page, which contains your Wear OS enrollment QR code.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:47.766
Now you can start enrolling your enterprise smartwatches. 

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:51.799
This process simply involves using your phone to scan the QR code once, 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.000
then using the same phone to enroll multiple enterprise smartwatches in succession.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.600
To scan the Wear OS enrollment QR code:

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.066
On your phone, open the Galaxy Wearable for Enterprise app.

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:08.966
If the app presents a first-time dialog, tap OK to proceed.

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:13.799
Tap Scan new QR code and scan the QR code with your phone’s camera.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.866
If the scan succeeds, QR code scanned successfully displays on the screen.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.199
Close the Galaxy Wearable for Enterprise app.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.300
Once Galaxy Wearable for Enterprise registers the QR code, you can enroll your enterprise smartwatch devices one-at-a-time. To do this:

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.233
Ensure that the Samsung Galaxy phone’s Bluetooth setting is turned on.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:39.466
Launch the Galaxy Wearable app, then pair with your Wear OS smartwatch (Watch4 or later).

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:42.866
Now it's time to enroll your Wear OS device

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.699
On the Galaxy Wearable home screen, tap Continue,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.133
then confirm that the pairing number on the smartwatch matches the one on your phone.

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:55.866
Read and agree to the End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:59.866
You can also select Sending of diagnostic data if you agree.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:08.232
If you consent to the Google Terms of Service, tap I agree. Then, tap Continue to set up the watch. This may take several minutes.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:18.866
Tap Continue if you agree to the Samsung Knox Privacy Policy 

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:24.032
and acknowledge that the watch isn’t private because your enterprise manages the watch.

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:28.033
The Knox Manage agent begins installing on the smartwatch.

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:44.266
When finished, the app notifies you that you’re all set. 

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:48.499
The watch detaches from the phone and begins to operate as a standalone device.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.966
If you have another watch that you want to enroll, tap Pair another watch to repeat the same process.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.333
