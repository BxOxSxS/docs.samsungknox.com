00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.995
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series. 

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:14.323
In this video, you'll learn how to get started with the Knox Manage new console.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:15.799
Let's jump right in. 

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:21.459
Knox Manage is a cloud-based Enterprise Mobility Management solution, or EMM, 

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:25.532
that lets you remotely manage your device fleet's apps and settings.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.633
The Knox Manage new console provides a familiar, 

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:32.801
yet much more streamlined user experience compared to the original console, 

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:38.307
making it easier for IT admins to set up and manage their device fleet with fewer steps. 

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:41.167
Before you can use the Knox Manage new console, 

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.548
you'll need to have a Samsung Knox account. 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.538
If you do not already have an account,

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:50.266
please go to Samsungknox.com and click GET STARTED to sign up before proceeding.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.482
You'll also need compatible devices. 

00:00:53.482 --> 00:01:01.266
Please see the supported device list at samsungknox.com for a complete list of devices supported by Knox Manage. 

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.762
To use the new console, you'll have to enable it in the Knox Admin Portal settings. 

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:12.037
To do this, click your account icon in the top right corner, then click Settings. 

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:15.227
Under KNOX MANAGE, click GENERAL SETTINGS. 

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:17.741
Select New console, then click SAVE. 

00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:21.156
If you want to switch back to the Knox Manage Original console, 

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:26.166
you can do so by repeating the same steps, and selecting the original console option.

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:30.999
The first thing you should do in the Knox Manage new console is create a user. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.537
Users in this context are the users of the devices, 

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:37.699
and not users of the Knox Manage console itself. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.990
Let's start by going to the Users page from the left navigation pane. 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.232
If it’s your first time using Knox Manage, this page will be empty.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.599
Click ADD USER. 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.500
On the following page, enter a user ID and password, then fill out the user’s information. 

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.521
Next, you’ll need to assign this user to a group. 

00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:03.526
You can either assign the user to an existing group, or create a new group if one doesn’t exist. 

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:06.399
Let’s create a new group by clicking CREATE GROUP.

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.932
In the dialog, enter a group name, then click CREATE. 

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:14.899
Confirm that your new group is selected in the drop down, then click CREATE. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.800
Back on the Users page, you’ll see a list of every user in your organization.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.391
Groups help keep your users organized,

00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:28.133
and are required in order to apply applications and profiles to your devices.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:33.466
After you create your users, you may want to also create additional groups in Knox Manage.

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:37.224
While you can create groups during the initial user creation process, 

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:41.832
you may find it more efficient to create new groups directly from the Groups page. 

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:47.656
For some larger organizations, this is especially helpful if you have users in different regions. 

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:50.925
Let’s say you have users in Canada and the United States. 

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:54.666
You can create two groups, one for each country respectively. 

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:59.266
Then, if you want to manage devices for both regions at the same time, 

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.740
you can easily create a new North America group. 

00:03:01.741 --> 00:03:06.370
To do this, click CREATE GROUP. On the next page, give your group a name, 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.899
then select the users you want to add from each region, then click CREATE.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.666
Back on the Groups page, you'll see a list of all Groups in the system. 

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:21.267
A key feature of Knox Manage is the ability to control which applications your devices have access to.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:26.227
IT admins can specify which apps can be installed, which apps are restricted, 

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:29.332
and whether or not apps can be removed by the user. 

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:34.432
Let's add our first app by going to the App library page, then clicking ADD APP. 

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.099
Search for the app you want to add, then click Select. In our example, we'll add the Knox Capture app to our devices.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.466
Search for the app you want to add, then click Select. In our example, we'll add the Knox Capture app to our devices.

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:46.866
Next, review or update the app details, then click ADD. 

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:51.030
Once apps are added to the library, they can be assigned to your devices. 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.065
Select the apps you want to assign, then click ACTIONS, followed by Assign app(s). 

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:01.033
On the following page, configure your app preferences, then click NEXT. 

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.166
Select the groups you want to assign the app to, then click NEXT.

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:08.732
Review your app assignment details, then click ASSIGN. 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.433
You can also assign apps to groups directly from the Groups page. To do this, select one or more groups, 

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:17.699
then click ACTION, Assign app.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:21.099
Select the apps you want to add, then click NEXT. 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.733
On the next screen, review your app settings, click NEXT, then click ASSIGN. 

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:30.099
Policies allow you to control how a device functions. 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.000
For example, with a policy, you can block users from using the camera, 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.766
prevent them from performing a device factory reset, and more.

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:42.431
Profiles are a collection of policies that you apply to a group of devices. 

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:46.432
In order to set a policy, you must first create a profile.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.666
To create your first profile, go to the Profiles page, then click CREATE PROFILE. 

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:55.831
On the following page, give your profile a name, then click NEXT.

00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:58.926
Choose the policies you want to add to this profile. 

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:03.366
In our example, we’ll create a policy that prevents the camera from being used. 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.633
Give your policy a unique name, and click NEXT. 

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:11.666
To assign the profile to a group, click CREATE AND ASSIGN.

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:15.299
Then, select a group, then click ASSIGN AND PUSH PROFILE. 

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:19.566
All users in that group should receive a policy update on their devices, 

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:21.266
which in our current example, 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.900
should result in the camera being disabled.

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:29.103
Now that you've created users, groups, and profiles, and added and assigned apps,

00:05:29.103 --> 00:05:32.028
you're ready to enroll devices into Knox Manage. 

00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:36.632
To start the enrollment process, go to the Users page, select the user, 

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:39.399
then click ACTIONS, Send enrollment guide.

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:45.017
An email will get sent to the user with detailed instructions and an enrollment QR code.

00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:49.710
On the device side, users simply need to turn on their new or factory-reset device, 

00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:54.232
then on the start screen, tap Welcome several times to launch the camera. 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.033
After scanning the enrollment QR code with their camera and following the setup wizard, 

00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:01.466
they will be asked to sign in to Knox Manage. 

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:04.615
Once they sign in and the enrollment process completes, 

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:08.618
they should see any apps you added, and receive any policies you set.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.432
In our case, we can see Knox Capture installed,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.900
and the camera disabled.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.101
Once enrollment completes, you can manage the device directly from the Devices page. 

00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:23.399
Click a device name to review its current configuration, 

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:25.232
or select a device, then click the ACTIONS button to perform tasks like locking a device, 

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:29.016
or select a device, then click the ACTIONS button to perform tasks like locking a device, 

00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:31.733
exiting kiosk mode, and more.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.100
This concludes our video on getting started with the Knox Manage new console.  

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.313
