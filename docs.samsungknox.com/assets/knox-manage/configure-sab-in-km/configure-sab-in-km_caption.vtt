00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.733
As an IT admin, you can configure Samsung Account for Business and Galaxy AI features through the Knox Service Plugin. 

2
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:14.299
On your Knox Manage console, go to the Profiles page, then click Add.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:23.866
Give your profile a name, select Android Enterprise, ensure Samsung Knox is also selected, then click Save & Set Policy.

4
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:28.066
Under the Samsung Knox policies, go to Knox-Service-Plugin.

5
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:33.508
If your fleet consists of company-owned devices, either fully managed or configured with a work profile, 

6
00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:39.132
go to Device-wide policies, then set Enable device policy controls to True.

7
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:43.663
If your fleet consists of personally-owned devices configured with a work profile, 

8
00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:49.299
go to Work-profile policies, then set Enable work profile policies to True.

9
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.747
Regardless of your device deployment type, the policies for enabling Samsung Account for Business remain the same.

10
00:00:55.747 --> 00:01:01.299
Under Device Account Policy, set Enable Device Account Policy controls to True, 

11
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.400
then in the Samsung Account configuration field, enable Samsung Account for Business.

12
00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:14.292
As an enterprise IT admin, you may want to block users from accessing certain Galaxy AI features

13
00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.165
if they can potentially impact your business.

14
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.110
For example, you may want to block Photo Assist 

15
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:25.166
if you want to prevent users from using AI to alter photos taken for work purposes.

16
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.033
To block AI features on company-owned devices, 

17
00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:32.436
open the Advanced Restriction policies under Device-wide policies. 

18
00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:37.059
By default, your devices will have all Galaxy AI features enabled. 

19
00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:42.532
If you want to block all AI features, set Block all Galaxy AI to True.

20
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:48.256
If you want to manually block specific AI features, set Block all Galaxy AI to False, 

21
00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:52.532
then in the Block individual Galaxy AI operations drop-down list, 

22
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:56.199
only select the Galaxy AI features that you want to block.

23
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.087
If your fleet consists of personally-owned devices configured with a work profile, 

24
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.832
you can find the same settings under Work profile policies.

25
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:10.348
Once you configure your Knox Service Plugin policies, click Save & Assign.

26
00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:17.232
On the next page, select the device group that you want to apply this profile to, then click Assign & push.

27
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.993
Once the devices receive the updated policies, 

28
00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:24.800
your end users will be able to sign into their Samsung business account, 

29
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.633
and use any Galaxy AI features you gave them access to.

30
00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:34.072
Now that you know how to configure Samsung account for business and Galaxy AI apps,

31
00:02:34.073 --> 00:02:40.233
see the 2nd video in the series to learn how end users can sign in and use these apps on their device.
