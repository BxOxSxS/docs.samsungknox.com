00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.765
In this video, we'll show you how to get started with using Knox Manage for Android Enterprise.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:23.699
There are a lot of great features to cover, so if you're excited and ready to learn, let's get started.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Knox Manage is a cloud-based Enterprise Mobility Management solution that lets IT admins

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.500
remotely manage the apps, contents, and features of their enterprise device fleet.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.366
By the end of this video, you'll learn how to launch Knox Manage and configure Android Enterprise,

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.033
create organizations and groups,

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.500
add users and enroll devices,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.900
manage applications,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.433
and finally, create profiles and manage Android Enterprise and Samsung Knox policies.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:01:00.433
Before you can begin using Knox Manage, you’ll need to ensure that

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:04.433
you have a Samsung Knox account. If you do not already have one,

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:09.599
please go to SamsungKnox.com and click Enroll to register.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:16.032
You also need to ensure that you've enabled Knox Manage as a service in the Knox Admin Portal.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:24.099
Please refer to our other video on Getting started with the Knox Admin Portal, for instructions on how to enable the service.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:28.099
You also must have a valid Gmail account.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:33.032
This is required for registering Knox Manage as an EMM with Google Play.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:38.166
and optionally, if you'd like to view the Knox Manage workflow from a device-user's point of view,

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:46.433
you'll need to have one or more mobile devices running Android 11 or higher, to following along with this video.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:54.066
Let's begin by logging into the Knox Admin Portal, and launching the Knox Manage console from the left navigation pane.

00:01:54.066 --> 00:02:01.900
Once Knox Manage launches, you’ll land on the Dashboard. This is a great resource for tracking your fleet’s enrollment history,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.585
user count, license status, and more. For new users, this dashboard will be empty.

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:15.321
Next, you’ll need to configure your Android Enterprise environment. Go to Settings,

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:21.520
click Android, then Android Enterprise, then click Register EMM.  

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:30.986
On Google Play, click Sign in. After you provide your Gmail credentials, click Get started to continue with the registration.

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:39.365
On the next page, provide your business name, then click Next.

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:42.957
On the Contact details page, after you've read and agreed to Google Play's terms and conditions,

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:47.362
click Confirm to complete the registration.

00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:52.041
One registration is complete, you'll land back on the Android Enterprise page

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.558
where you can view your EMM registration information.

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.882
You're now ready to start using Knox Manage.

00:02:57.882 --> 00:03:02.182
Let's begin by creating Organizations and Groups.

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:07.767
Organizations and Groups help to keep your devices and users organized,

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:13.206
and are required in order to configure and manage device policies and apps in your fleet.

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:19.422
Knox Manage includes default organizations and groups when you first set up the service.

00:03:19.422 --> 00:03:26.386
However, it's recommended that you create your own, as the default names may not be intuitive, or relevant to your business.

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:33.446
For example, the default Organization name is called "Undefined", and the default Group is named after your tenant ID.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:45.113
Let’s first create an Organization. To do this, click Add, then provide an organization code and name, then click Save.

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:51.751
In some large companies, it’s common to have several parent organizations, each with their own children,

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:59.365
to reflect the different sides of the business. In this example, we’ll create 2 parents to represent our business in different countries.

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:04.278
then, under each parent, we can create children, to represent the different regions.

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:12.848
Now that we've created a few organizations, let's go and create some groups.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.463
On the group page, click Add, then provide a Group Name and Group Type, then click Save.

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:28.608
One slight difference between groups and organizations is that you can create either a Device group or a User group,

00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:32.249
but you cannot create a device or user organization.

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.508
In our example, we'll create a few User groups to represent our different regional offices,

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.263
and one Device group to represent all Galaxy S23 devices in our fleet.

00:04:46.648 --> 00:04:51.699
The next thing you'll need to do is add a few users into Knox Manage.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.570
Note that users in this case are users of the devices in your fleet, and not users who log into the Knox Manage console.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.172
On the User page, click Add to add a single user into Knox Manage,

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:09.788
or click Bulk Add to add multiple users, using a template.

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.934
In our example, we'll add a single user by clicking Add.

00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:22.716
On the Add User page, fill out the user's credentials, then assign that user to an organization or a group.

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:28.705
You can also choose to assign the user to both an organization and a group at the same time.

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:38.471
After this, you can leave the default fields the way they are, then click Save &amp; Request Enrollment.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:43.465
The user will receive instructions on how to enroll their device into Knox Manage.

00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:47.535
For this video, we'll enroll devices on a user's behalf,

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:52.697
but these steps can be followed by any device end-user in your organization.

00:05:52.698 --> 00:05:59.273
There are several ways in which you can enroll a device, depending on how you want to manage them.

00:05:59.274 --> 00:06:03.023
If you want to enroll a personal device into Knox Manage,

00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:08.400
and be able to help the user manage company apps and policies in a work profile,

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:12.582
then you'll need to download the Knox Manage agent from Google Play.

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:20.350
Once the agent is downloaded and installed, on the Sign in screen, enter your user ID and tenant ID.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.267
After you provide your password, tap SIGN IN,

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:30.059
The Knox Manage agent will begin setting up a work profile on the personal device.

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:38.969
Review the privacy policy, then if you agree to them, tap I agree, then tap NEXT.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.546
The Knox Manage agent will ask if you want to allow location tracking for the app.

00:06:44.547 --> 00:06:48.391
You need to select Allow all, then tap the back button to continue.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.345
Once enrollment is complete, the agent will show you that you're successfully signed in.

00:06:55.345 --> 00:07:00.871
A notification appears, asking if you want to delete the agent from the device.

00:07:00.872 --> 00:07:06.581
After your personal device is enrolled, the agent has no further use, so you can go ahead and delete it.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.285
If you are providing users with a company-owned device,

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:18.648
then you can enroll these devices using a token method.

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:23.327
For the token enrollment method to work, you must have a factory-reset device.

00:07:23.328 --> 00:07:32.555
On the device screen, tap Start. Then, after reviewing and agreeing to the terms and conditions, tap Agree.

00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:37.767
Then connect to an available Wi-Fi network, then tap Next.

00:07:37.768 --> 00:07:45.268
On the Sign in screen, enter the enrollment token in the Email or phone field, then tap Next.

00:07:45.268 --> 00:07:50.317
Then on the next screen, you'll be asked how you want to use this phone.

00:07:50.318 --> 00:07:53.922
Depending on how you want the devices to be managed,

00:07:53.922 --> 00:08:00.739
choose either Fully managed device, or Work profile on a company-owned device.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.305
For fully managed devices, the user can only use apps and features set by the IT admin.

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:10.550
For Work profile on a company-owned device,

00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:15.793
the users have access to a personal profile where they can access their own apps and data,

00:08:15.793 --> 00:08:20.972
as well as a separate work profile for IT admins to manage and monitor.

00:08:20.972 --> 00:08:27.795
Once you select your manage mode, the Knox Manage agent continues with the enrollment process.

00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:33.154
On the sign in screen, enter a user ID and tenant ID, as well as a password,

00:08:33.155 --> 00:08:36.986
then tap SIGN IN to enroll the device.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.963
Once your devices are enrolled, they will appear in the Device page in the Knox Manage console.

00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:55.313
Here you can see which devices are company-owned, and which are personally-owned with a work profile.

00:08:57.337 --> 00:08:59.818
Let's move onto Applications.

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:06.672
One of the core features of Knox Manage is the ability to manage applications for enterprise devices.

00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:12.763
As an IT admin, you can specify which apps your users have access to, which apps are restricted,

00:09:12.764 --> 00:09:16.508
and whether or not apps can be removed by the user.

00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:22.586
To add apps into Knox Manage, click Application, then click Add.

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:27.829
In Select Application Type, ensure that Android is selected, then click Next.

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:30.134
The Managed Google Play window opens.

00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:35.449
This is where you can search for the apps that you want to manage for your device fleet.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:42.120
Once you find the app you're looking for, click Select, then click Save to add the apps to Knox Manage.

00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.649
The application appears in the list on the Application page.

00:09:45.649 --> 00:09:53.026
Once you have apps added to Knox Manage, you'll need to assign them to a group or

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:57.171
organization, in order to deploy them to your devices.

00:09:57.172 --> 00:10:04.685
You can choose to assign an app individually, or you can select multiple apps and assign them in bulk.

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:15.120
And finally, let's take a look at the Profiles feature of Knox Manage.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.654
A Profile is a set of policies containing various device configurations and settings.

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:25.360
To create a profile, go to the Profile page, then click Add.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.184
On the Add profile page, give your profile a name, then select Android Enterprise.

00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:36.635
Notice that Samsung Knox is also selected by default.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:45.491
This allows us to set additional Samsung Knox-specific policies, in addition to the Android Enterprise policies for our devices.

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:55.682
On the Set Policy page, locate the Android Enterprise policy that you want to configure.

00:10:55.683 --> 00:11:01.808
In our example, we will allow the system camera to be used on a personal profile,

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:05.582
but we will disallow the camera to be used on a work profile.

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:13.208
Under Samsung Knox, there are additional policies that work in tandem with the Android Enterprise policies,

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:18.622
and they provide additional customization options for Samsung-specific devices.

00:11:18.622 --> 00:11:25.465
For example, we can set a Samsung Knox policy to prevent Wi-Fi hotspotting on Samsung Knox devices.

00:11:25.466 --> 00:11:33.851
Once you've specified the Android Enterprise and Samsung Knox policies that you want, click Save &amp; Assign.

00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:46.138
On the Assign Profile page, select the group or organization that you want to push the profile to, then click Assign &amp; Apply.

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:52.860
In the pop-up window, you can review the policies that you will be pushing to the organization or group,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.835
then click OK to confirm.

00:11:55.835 --> 00:12:01.208
Once you apply the profile, the users in the organizations or groups

00:12:01.209 --> 00:12:05.832
should see the policy changes appear on their devices.

00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:13.307
This concludes our video on getting started with Knox Manage for Android Enterprise.

00:12:13.308 --> 00:12:17.247
