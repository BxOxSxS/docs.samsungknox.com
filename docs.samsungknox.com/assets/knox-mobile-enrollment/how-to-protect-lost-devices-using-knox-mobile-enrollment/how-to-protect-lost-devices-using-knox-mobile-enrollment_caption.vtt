00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:13.066
Welcome to the Knox video training series.
In this video, 

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:17.899
we will show you how to easily and quickly protect our devices in the event of loss or theft.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.500
Let's get started.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.700
This video is for administrators who have already created an advanced profile. 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.733
Information on how to create such a profile can be found at docs.samsungknox.com.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:36.966
In order to use this function, we need a device enrolled in the EMM based on the prepared KME Advanced profile.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:42.399
Please note that the KME Advanced profile only works with an active Knox Suite license. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.000
This function allows us to lock a device regardless of whether or not the device supports EMM communication.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.566
Let's move on to a demonstration of how we can use the device locking function.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:01:00.466
In the Knox Admin Portal, after navigating to the Knox Mobile Enrollment console, go to the Advanced tab in the Devices menu. 

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:05.132
This tab will quickly allow you to list all the devices assigned to an advanced profile. 

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:11.399
You will now learn how to use the device locking function. This function will only work on devices with the Enrolled status, 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.633
which is shown in green in the console. 
Devices can be locked individually 

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:21.633
by navigating to the device details or altogether by selecting the relevant devices and clicking the Actions button.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:32.699
A change of color will indicate the activation status of the function. We will discuss what the colors represent at the end of this video. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.600
To lock the device within the details, simply move the slider next to the Lock option.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:46.866
Select a number of devices from the device list and click the Actions button. In the menu that appears, select Lock.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:50.699
In the adjacent window, you can see what is happening on one of the devices.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.766
The lock function works independently of the EMM vendor. We can have different enrollment profiles in the KME console for different EMMs 

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.299
and the lock will work on all the devices we have selected from the list.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300
In the Actions menu, you can also do the opposite, i.e. you can unlock locked devices.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.766
This mechanism works when the device is connected to the Internet. But what if the device is not connected to the Internet?

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:26.899
In the next step, I will show you how to unlock a device if there is no connection, e.g. due to a lack of Internet connection on the device.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.333
In a situation where we are not connected to the device and it is locked, we can unlock it using a PIN generated in the KME console.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:38.399
Go to the device details and click the PIN button.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.366
In the window that appears, enter the passkey that is visible on the screen of the locked device. 

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:48.166
It is displayed in the top message with information about the owner of the device.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:55.899
The passkey is generated once. Once it has been used, the system will generate a new passkey when you lock the device again.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.100
After entering the passkey in the console window, click the button that will generate the PIN.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.166
Enter the generated PIN in the dedicated field on the locked device.

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:23.166
A very useful tool for administrators is the ability to check whether a device is locked or unlocked.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:27.332
Green indicates that the device is not locked.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:32.266
Yellow means that the device is in the process of being locked or unlocked.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:38.932
Red indicates that the device is locked. With this status, the PIN generation button is also active. 

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.299
I discussed how to use the PIN a little earlier.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.633
That's it. That's everything you need to know about the function for locking lost and stolen devices.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:51.199
I encourage you to use our guides available at docs.samsungknox.com, 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.433
where you will find all the information you need on settings and descriptions of our other products. 

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:02.899
See you soon in the next video about the new functions within the Advanced Profile at Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME).

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.966
Thanks for watching!
