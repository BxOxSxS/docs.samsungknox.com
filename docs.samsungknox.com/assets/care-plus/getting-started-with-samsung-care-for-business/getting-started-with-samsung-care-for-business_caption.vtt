00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:12.283
Hello and welcome to this Knox training video on Getting started with Samsung Care+ for Business.

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:18.484
In this getting-started video, we’ll show you the basics of Samsung Care+ for Business.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.962
You’ll learn how to access the Samsung Care+ for Business service, 

00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:28.816
how to enter and assign licenses, how to navigate the dashboard, and how to submit a service request.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.666
Let's jump right in.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.187
Let's jump right in.

00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:36.664
Before you can begin using Samsung Care+ for Business, you'll need to ensure the following:

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:42.666
First, you need to purchase a Samsung Care+ for Business license from an authorized license reseller.

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:51.466
To find an authorized license reseller, go to samsungknox.com, then under Contact Sales, click FIND A PARTNER.

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:56.183
On the next page, use the filters to select your location.

00:00:56.183 --> 00:01:04.566
In the TYPE field, select Knox License Reseller, then expand the PRODUCTS filter and select Samsung Care+ for Business.

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.999
Next, you'll need a Samsung Knox account.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:14.799
If you don't already have one, go to samsungknox.com and click GET STARTED to apply.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.200
Finally, you'll need to purchase devices from an authorized device reseller and have them uploaded to your account.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.183
To allow resellers to upload devices directly to your account, you'll need to provide them with your unique Knox Customer ID.

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:36.499
You can find this customer ID by logging into the Knox Admin Portal, then going to your account information.

00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:42.803
If you're a Knox Suite customer using Samsung Care+ for Business for the first time,

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.882
you may need to enable the service in the Knox Admin Portal.

00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:51.666
Check out our video on Getting started with Knox Admin Portal to learn how to enable additional services.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:57.419
After the service is enabled, you'll see a link in the left navigation pane.

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:01.632
Click this link to view the Samsung Care+ for Business console menu.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.450
Next, you'll need to register your device reseller so they can upload devices to your account.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.966
To do this, obtain their Knox Reseller ID, then navigate to the Resellers page and click REGISTER RESELLER.

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:19.549
Enter the reseller ID, then click Look up.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:25.116
Confirm the Reseller information, then click REGISTER to add this reseller to your console.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:31.249
Any devices uploaded by this reseller will now appear in the UPLOADS tab on the Devices page.

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:36.954
Now that you have access to the console and there are devices uploaded to your account,

00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:42.749
the next step is to enter the Samsung Care+ for Business license key that you purchased from your reseller.

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:45.716
To enter the license key,

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:51.382
Cilck licenses from the left menu, then go to ACTIONS and click Enter a license key.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.450
Give your key a name, then enter your purchased license key number.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.866
If the key is valid, you'll see the license details including the total seats available, and license expiration date.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:07.383
You'll need to assign this license to your devices before the expiration date,

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:11.716
in order to activate your Samsung Care+ for Business coverage plan.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:13.766
Click Add to enter the key.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.750
On the Licenses page, you'll find the newly added license.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.050
Click the License name to view the number of available seats,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.666
as well as the license assignment end date,

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:26.549
and the license coverage type.

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:32.666
For example, this includes Accidental Damage from Handling or Extended Warranty.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.466
The next step after entering your license key is assigning the license to your devices.

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.568
When assigning a license to devices,

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.121
you must assign it before the end of its license expiration date, 

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.881
otherwise known as the Assignment end date.

00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:47.916
Expiration dates may vary depending on your region 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.650
Expiration dates may vary depending on your region 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.516
and the type of coverage you purchased.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.573
and the type of coverage you purchased.

00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:57.134
In addition to the license Assignment end date, 

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.463
you must also pay attention to the license’s Device eligible period. 

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:05.087
This is the length of time in which you can assign the license to a device, 

00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:08.500
after turning on the device for the first time and accepting the 

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:08.583
End User License Agreement, or EULA.  

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.166
End User License Agreement, or EULA.  

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.549
End User License Agreement, or EULA.  

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.595
If you purchased Accidental Damage from Handling, or ADH coverage, 

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:19.780
you’ll receive coverage if you either assign your license 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.632
before or during the Device eligible period, 

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:28.007
and the assignment also happens sometime between the license Start date and Assignment end date.

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:33.483
If you purchased Extended Warranty, or EW coverage,

00:04:33.483 --> 00:04:39.381
you'll receive coverage if you assign the license before or during the device's Basic Warranty Period,

00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:45.115
and the assignment also happens sometime between the license Start date and Assignment end date.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.034
The Basic warranty period varies by region and device type. 

00:04:50.034 --> 00:04:55.462
Please contact your Samsung Care+ for Business sales rep for more information about your devices 

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.649
and their Extended Warranty coverage.

00:04:58.366 --> 00:05:00.799
To ensure that you receive proper coverage, 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.416
we recommend always turning on the device and accepting the

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:05.999
End User License Agreement

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.796
before the Assignment end date,

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:09.966
regardless of coverage type.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.300
Once you’re ready to assign a license to your devices,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.060
select the license that you want to assign, then click Actions followed by Assign license.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.516
You can also assign a license by clicking the License name, then clicking ASSIGN LICENSE from the side panel.

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:33.016
On the Assign license page, you'll find a list of available devices for you to assign the license to.

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:33.864
On the Assign license page, you'll find a list of available devices for you to assign the license to.

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:40.342
By default, all available devices are selected, provided that enough license seats are available.

00:05:40.343 --> 00:05:40.499
Select the devices you want to assign the license to, then click ASSIGN.

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:46.149
Select the devices you want to assign the license to, then click ASSIGN.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:52.366
On the Devices page, your newly assigned devices will show Active pending in the Status column.

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:59.253
After the license assignment completes, go back to the License page where you can see the total number of seats purchased,

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:05.334
remaining license seats available, and other important information to help you manage the license.

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:05.432
Click the link in the ASSIGNED column to view the devices assigned to that license.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.416
Click the link in the ASSIGNED column to view the devices assigned to that license.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.412
After you've assigned your devices to a Samsung Care+ for Business license,

00:06:15.412 --> 00:06:18.199
you can track your fleet's coverage on the Dashboard.

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:23.023
In the COVERAGE section, you can quickly see how many license seats you own,

00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:28.482
what type of protection plans you've purchased, and how many claims you have open or in progress.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.300
Devices in the Active stage indicate that they are covered by a Samsung Care+ for Business plan,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.516
and Inactive means devices have their Samsung Care+ for Business license expired, cancelled, or failed.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.990
In this last part of the video,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.849
we'll briefly explain how to submit a service request in the Samsung Care+ for Business console.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.422
This process differs for each country, but generally follows a similar path.

00:06:54.422 --> 00:07:00.151
From the Samsung Care+ for Business console, click Service request in the left menu.

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:06.699
For most countries, a Service Guide tile explains the service request procedure for that specific country.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.433
Follow the instructions in this tile, as it provides important information related to your country.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.195
For some countries supporting integration with an insurer's system,

00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:22.999
you can click the SUBMIT A SERVICE REQUEST button to log into the insurer's portal and make a claim.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.868
If you don't see a button, you can find detailed information on how to submit a service request in the Service request tile,

00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:34.139
or by viewing the Samsung Care+ for Business claim guide for your country.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:37.566
We'll provide a link to the claim guides in the video description.

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:44.783
After you submit a ticket in the insurer's portal, you can head back to the Dashboard to view your claim statuses.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:50.532
