00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.180
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.625
In this video, we’ll show you how to get started with using Knox Guard. Let’s begin.

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:22.006
Knox Guard is a cloud-based service that lets you protect your devices,

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:26.941
enterprise assets, and payment plans from fraud and theft.

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:31.612
With Knox Guard, you can remotely manage, message, and, if necessary,

00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:36.061
lock Samsung devices to reduce your organization's financial risk,

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:42.266
prevent the grey market sales of devices, and recover overdue subscriber payments.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.204
Before you can use Knox Guard, you’ll need the following:

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:49.221
You must have a Samsung Knox account. 

00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:56.028
If you do not already have one, please visit Samsungknox.com, then click GET STARTED to register.

00:00:56.028 --> 00:01:00.830
You’ll need a Samsung device running a supported Knox version. 

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.898
Depending on your device model, this version may differ.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.799
To see which devices are supported, as well as their required Knox versions,

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.466
please go to Samsungknox.com, then select Solutions,

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.096
 then Knox devices.

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:20.646
On the next page, select Knox Guard to view the list of supported devices.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:25.132
And finally, you’ll need to be granted access to the Knox Guard service. 

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:28.155
This service is disabled by default. 

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:34.175
To apply for access, log into the Knox Admin Portal and enable the Knox Guard service. 

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:37.132
A local Samsung administrator will review your request,

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:41.133
approve your application, and configure your Knox Guard service.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:48.566
Once this is done, you can log back into the Knox Admin Portal to launch the Knox Guard console.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:51.536
To use Knox Guard, you’ll need a license.

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:57.132
First-time users can generate a Knox Guard trial license to begin using the service.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:02.083
A trial license lets you test Knox Guard features for up to 3 months, 

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:05.132
and enroll up to 30 devices. 

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.269
However, after you enroll your devices into the service,

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.701
you’ll be able to use Knox Guard for up to 3 years, from the date of enrollment. 

00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:17.547
This means each device can enjoy a full three-year usage from its enrollment date, 

00:02:17.547 --> 00:02:20.499
regardless of the license expiry date.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:29.522
To get a trial license, start by going to the Licenses page, then click GET A LICENSE. 

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:33.738
In the dialogue, click GENERATE A TRIAL LICENCE

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.430
Once a license is generated, you can enroll your devices.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.460
To enroll devices into Knox Guard, they must first be uploaded to your console. 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.450
There are several ways to get devices uploaded to your console: 

00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:52.284
Through a Samsung approved reseller, or by manually uploading them with a CSV file.

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:57.132
We'll start with showing you how to allow resellers to upload devices.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:00.724
First, you’ll need to obtain their Knox Reseller ID. 

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:05.322
Once you have that, go to the Resellers page, then click REGISTER RESELLER.

00:03:05.323 --> 00:03:09.357
On the next page, enter the reseller ID then click LOOK UP, 

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:12.462
then if that matches your reseller information, click REGISTER.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:18.338
Once you’ve registered the reseller in your Knox Guard console, provide them with your Knox Customer ID

00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:25.558
so that they can upload devices directly to your account. You can find your Customer ID on the Reseller page. 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.694
To manage reseller preferences, click the reseller name. 

00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:34.554
Here you can select whether you want to auto-approve all devices uploaded by this reseller, 

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:39.011
and whether you want to automatically lock all newly uploaded devices. 

00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:45.999
If you prefer to manually add devices to Knox Guard instead of using a reseller, go to the Devices page,

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:51.509
then click ACTIONS &gt; Manage devices &gt; Upload devices. 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.798
Then on the next page, select your CSV file and click CONFIRM.

00:03:57.798 --> 00:04:03.533
Now that your devices are added to the Knox Guard console, they are ready for enrollment.

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:07.003
Simply turn on a new or factory-reset device,

00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:11.945
then the devices will enroll into Knox Guard after they complete their setup.

00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:17.352
Back on the console, you can go to the Dashboard page to see your enrollment status. 

00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:20.745
Devices that were successfully enrolled show as Active.

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:24.270
Devices that have been uploaded, but not successfully enrolled 

00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:28.299
will show up as Activating in the In progress tile.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.075
Policies define how your devices behave in the event of fraud, theft, or mis-use.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:40.299
As previously mentioned, when you first apply for access to Knox Guard, 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.414
a local Samsung administrator reviews your application.

00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:45.928
During this time, the Samsung administrator

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:50.086
sets up your Knox Guard service as either a Normal account type,

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.509
or as a Pay-As-You-Go account type.

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.623
Depending on your account type, the policy options differ slightly.

00:04:56.624 --> 00:05:00.738
Let’s take a closer look at some of the key Knox Guard policies.

00:05:00.738 --> 00:05:04.299
We’ll mainly focus on the Normal account type in this video.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.818
In the Device Lock section, you’ll see two options: LOCK SCREEN and OFFLINE LOCK.

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:15.407
For PAYG account types, you’ll see PAY-AS-YOU-GO LOCK SCREEN. 

00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:19.389
Let’s create a LOCK SCREEN policy. 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.990
In the Message field, enter the text that you want to display on the screen after you lock a device.

00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:32.279
While the device is locked, you can choose whether you want devices to block incoming calls,

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.299
or allow calls from specific numbers.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.091
In the CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPTIONS, you can provide a phone number or email

00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.710
for customers to contact when their devices are locked.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.373
If you want display an app on the device lock screen (for example a payment app)

00:05:48.374 --> 00:05:52.003
you can add the app here after uploading it to Knox Guard.

00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:57.960
We’ll show you how to upload an app to Knox Guard in the Advanced Controls section of this video.

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:01.573
And finally, in the Primary support option field, 

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:08.299
you can add a quick link to either a Phone number or an Application on the main screen when the device is locked.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.266
If you select None, the users will still be able to contact you or use the app after tapping the support button.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.224
After you configure your Lock screen settings, click SAVE.

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:22.896
Let’s take a quick look at the OFFLINE LOCK policy.

00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:25.973
OFFLINE LOCK puts your devices into lock mode 

00:06:25.974 --> 00:06:30.711
if they don’t connect to a Wi-Fi or mobile network for a certain length of time.

00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:36.168
To use OFFLINE LOCK, you’ll need to specify the number of days the device can remain offline,

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.050
after which the device will enter lock mode. 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.811
Provide a warning message to send to the user before device lock occurs, 

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:47.999
then provide a message to display to users after their devices get locked.

00:06:49.094 --> 00:06:53.669
Just like with the LOCK SCREEN policy, you can block calls, display an app, 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.205
and specify the primary support option when configuring OFFLINE LOCK.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Let’s now look at the ADVANCED CONTROLS options for Policies,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.682
Specifically SIM CONTROL and APPLICATION INSTALLATION.

00:07:07.682 --> 00:07:12.532
These options are the same for both Normal and PAYG account types.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:16.577
In SIM CONTROL, you can specify what happens when your users insert

00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:19.432
unauthorized SIM cards into your devices.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:22.799
To create a SIM CONTROL policy, click the add button,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.233
then give your SIM CONROL policy a name.

00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:31.533
Then enter a Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network code for the SIM cards that you want authorize. 

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:35.234
Then for any unauthorized SIM cards, you can prevent actions like

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:39.532
making outgoing calls or receiving incoming calls on the device.

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:45.014
If you want, you can also lock the device entirely once an unauthorized SIM card is inserted.

00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:49.965
If you select Lock device, you’ll apply the same LOCK SCREEN policy that you set earlier.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.641
Configure your SIM CONTROL policy then click SAVE to return to the Policies page.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:01.368
Switching over to the APPLICATION INSTALLATION page, this is where you upload an APK file

00:08:01.368 --> 00:08:06.610
for the app you want to display on the Lock screen (for example, a payment app). 

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.699
Click UPLOAD to add your APK file, then click SAVE.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.700
In the confirmation dialogue, click CONFIRM to add the application.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.463
Then head back to the LOCK SCREEN policy page, go to Advanced support methods,

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:22.479
and select Make an application available.

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.699
Click the IMPORT button, then on the dialogue, click OK.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.916
The application name and package name will auto-populate.

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:33.006
Click SAVE to return to the Policies page.

00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:37.361
The application that you just uploaded will now be available on the lock screen.

00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:41.493
The next policies we’ll quickly look at will be the MESSAGING policies.

00:08:41.494 --> 00:08:44.557
These are NOTIFICATIONS and BLINKING REMINDERS.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:49.141
For PAYG account types,these are NOTIFICATIONS and RELOCK REMINDER

00:08:49.142 --> 00:08:54.699
With Notifications, you can configure up to 10 custom messages to send to users.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.507
Users will receive these messages regardless of whether their devices are locked or unlocked. 

00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:04.232
If you want to have users call you back after receiving the message,

00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:08.690
you can also provide an optional phone number to go along with the notifications. 

00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:12.454
Similar to the Notifications, the Blinking reminder policy

00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:17.366
sends a single message to users periodically, until you cancel the policy. 

00:09:17.866 --> 00:09:21.254
You can set the reminder frequency (in seconds, minutes, or hours),

00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:25.666
and limit the reminders to only display during certain times in the day.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.125
Now that we’ve set several key policies, let’s look at how we can actually put them into use. 

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:34.980
All policies get deployed from the Devices page. 

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.700
Select one or more devices, then click the ACTIONS menu button.

00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:42.933
Then under Manage policy, select the policy that you want to deploy. 

00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:45.127
Let’s try locking the screen.

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:48.866
Select Lock device(s) to deploy the Lock screen policy. 

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.700
Review the policy details, then click LOCK.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:55.642
The user’s device screen will lock,

00:09:55.642 --> 00:09:59.055
and they will be shown the lock screen message that you set up earlier.

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:03.375
Users can tap the support button to display all lock screen options.

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:07.770
From here, users can make a call, send an email, use the provided application,

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.432
or enter a PIN number to unlock their device.

00:10:11.366 --> 00:10:16.713
If you previously set a primary support option, a button will appear on the main lock screen. 

00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:20.736
In our example, we set a phone number as our primary option. 

00:10:20.737 --> 00:10:25.699
Here we can see a call button on the main screen after we lock our device.

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:30.566
Back on the console, you can unlock the devices in one of two ways.

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:33.604
The first way is to unlock from the ACTIONS menu. 

00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:40.960
After you select one or more devices, click ACTIONS &gt; Manage policy &gt; Unlock device(s). 

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.566
In the next page, enter an optional unlock message, then the devices will unlock.

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:49.913
The second way is to unlock the device through a PIN method.

00:10:49.914 --> 00:10:55.376
This method requires a unique passkey number that is displayed on the lock screen.

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:58.006
Once the user provides you with the number,

00:10:58.007 --> 00:11:01.232
enter it by clicking the PIN button in the STATUS column.

00:11:01.232 --> 00:11:05.914
After you enter the passkey and confirm that you want to unlock, click CONTINUE. 

00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:08.392
You’ll then be given a new PIN number. 

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:12.813
Provide this PIN number to the user and ask them to enter it on the lock screen.

00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:15.899
Once they enter this PIN, their device will unlock.

00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:20.816
Let's now quickly take a look at pushing a Notification.

00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:26.636
Select one or more devices, then click ACTIONS &gt; Manage policy &gt; Send notifications.

00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:33.365
On the next page, select one of the custom messages that you want to push, then click SEND. 

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:39.089
To push the Blinking reminder, 

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:46.492
follow a similar procedure, click ACTIONS &gt; Manage Policy &gt; Start blinking reminder. 

00:11:46.493 --> 00:11:52.565
On the next page, make any changes to the reminder settings if you wish, then click START.

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:56.132
The device will send repeated reminders until you stop them.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.866
To stop the reminders, select Stop blinking reminder, then click CONFIRM.

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:11.316
Let’s now quickly demonstrate how users can launch an app from the lock screen.

00:12:11.316 --> 00:12:15.132
To do this, let’s lock the device from the console. 

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:20.833
On the device, users can tap the Support button, then tap the application button to launch the app.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.066
If you set an application as the primary support option, then the app will also appear on the main lock screen. 

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:34.433
The last thing we’ll demonstrate is the SIM Control policy.

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:40.833
On the Devices page, select the devices, click ACTIONS &gt; Manage policies &gt; Enable SIM control.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.000
On the next page, review your SIM control settings and click CONFIRM. 

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.489
On the device itself, if users swap out the SIM card, they will be restricted or locked out, 

00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:54.699
based on how you configured the policy.

00:12:55.866 --> 00:12:59.766
To remove the policy, select Disable SIM control.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.100
This concludes our walkthrough of Knox Guard. 

00:13:05.866 --> 00:13:11.032
To learn more, please visit our documentation at docs.samsungknox.com. 

00:13:11.766 --> 00:13:15.668
For customers looking to integrate Knox Guard into an existing solution, 

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:18.499
we also provide a powerful Knox Guard API. 

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:22.866
You can learn more about this API through our developer documentation page,

00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:26.866
which can also be found at docs.samsungknox.com.

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:28.632
Thanks for watching!
