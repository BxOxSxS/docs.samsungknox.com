00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.333
Welcome to the Knox video training series!

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.083
In this video, we’ll show you how to set up key mapping

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:17.333
for Microsoft Teams walkie talkie mode using the Knox Service Plugin

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.716
in VMware Workspace ONE.

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:23.016
This lets you simply press the hardware key on an XCover Pro 

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:28.832
or other compatible Samsung devices to instantly communicate with your teammates through Microsoft Teams.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:29.766
Let’s get started!

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:34.382
Before you enable key mapping for Microsoft Teams walkie talkie mode, you first need to:

00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:38.366
Obtain a Knox Suite or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.149
Log in to the VMware Workspace ONE UEM console.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.733
Then, link your VMware Workspace One UEM console with a Managed Google Account to deploy Android Enterprise devices. 

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:52.766
Finally, enroll your Galaxy XCover Pro devices in Android Enterprise Device Owner mode.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.366
To map Microsoft Teams walkie talkie mode to the

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.566
push-to-talk button on your XCover Pro devices, you’ll need to:

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.733
Add the Knox Service Plugin in  your VMware Workspace ONE console.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:08.266
Configure key mapping for Microsoft Teams in the Knox Service Plugin policies.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.632
And deploy the policies to your devices.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:16.949
To add the Knox Service Plugin, first log into your VMware Workspace ONE console.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.083
In the left sidebar, click Apps &amp; Books, then Native. 

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:27.483
On the top navigation menu, click Public, then ADD APPLICATION.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:34.083
Fill in the Platform and Name fields as shown, then click APPROVE.

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:36.766
Now that you’ve added the Knox Service Plugin as an approved app,

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:41.116
let’s edit the App Configurations to set up the key mapping feature. 

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:46.266
In the left sidebar, click Apps &amp; Books, then Native.

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:49.849
On the top navigation menu, click Public.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.300
In the search field, enter “Knox Service Plugin”. 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.883
Find the Knox Service Plugin app, then click the icon.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.866
On the detailed view page, click ASSIGN.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.783
In the Assignment popup that appears, select the name of the group your XCover Pro device is assigned to.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.383
You’ll see a dialog box appear.

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:15.266
This is where we’ll configure the push-to-talk functionality for your XCover Pro devices. 

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:19.382
In the left sidebar, click Application Configuration. 

00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:24.666
Next to Device-wide policies, click Edit to expand the list of policies.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:29.099
Scroll down to Device Key Mapping, and click the tab to expand it. 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.083
Next to Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams, select Enable.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:39.349
Configure the rest of the Knox Service Plugin policies 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.283
according to your organization’s needs, then click Save.

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:48.016
You’ll be taken back to the Assignment screen. Click Save.

00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:52.149
You can then preview your assigned devices before deploying your changes.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.383
After you’re done, click Publish to push the policy to the devices.

00:02:57.383 --> 00:03:00.599
You can also access the Send Application Configuration option 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.600
through the Knox Service Plugin details page.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.100
Now, if Microsoft Teams is running in the background, 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.833
you can chat with your colleagues with just a push of the hardware key 

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.649
on your XCover Pro, or other compatible devices such as the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.266
XCover 4S, Xcover 5, or Tab Active 3.

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.632
This concludes the demo of how to set up key mapping

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.249
for Microsoft Teams walkie talkie mode

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.900
using the Knox Service Plugin in VMware Workspace ONE.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.383
