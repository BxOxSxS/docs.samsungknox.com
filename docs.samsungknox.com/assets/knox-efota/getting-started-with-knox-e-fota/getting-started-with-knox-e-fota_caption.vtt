00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.666
Hello and welcome to this Samsung Knox training video on getting started with Knox E-FOTA.

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.575
In this video, we'll show you what Knox E-FOTA is, the different features it offers,

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:20.741
and how it can be used to manage and schedule firmware and OS updates on your devices.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:27.486
You'll learn how to register a reseller, approve a device, create and assign a campaign, and monitor device statuses.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.766
So if you're new to Knox E-FOTA, then this video is for you.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.800
Let's get started.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.933
Before you begin, you'll need an account at samsungknox.com.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.366
For more information, check out our video on getting started with the Knox Admin Portal.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.433
You’ll also need Samsung devices running Android 9.0 or higher.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:51.608
To use Knox E-FOTA, you’ll need a valid Knox Suite license, which includes access to Knox E-FOTA along with other Knox services.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.617
Note that a trial license is generated when you first register for a Samsung Knox account.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:01.053
If you don't have a valid Knox Suite license, refer to our Knox Suite video for more info.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.586
Knox E-FOTA allows you to remotely deploy operating system, firmware,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.299
and security updates to corporate devices without any user interaction.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:14.640
With the ability to test, schedule, and monitor OS updates as well as app compatibility prior to deployment,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.033
Knox E-FOTA enables you to confidently manage large device fleets with minimal effort.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:23.232
To start using Knox E-FOTA, sign in to your Samsung Knox account.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.232
Once the Knox Admin Portal launches, you’ll see Knox E-FOTA on the left navigation pane.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.500
If you don’t see it, click the account icon in the top-right to access portal settings,

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:37.685
then click Show/Hide services and select Knox E-FOTA from the list of Knox cloud services.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.652
The first page you’ll see is the Dashboard, which provides a quick summary of the different statuses of your enterprise devices,

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:49.764
such as the firmware download or installation status, the security patch rate, the campaign status, and much more.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.200
To start using Knox E-FOTA, the first thing you'll need to do is to upload a device.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.266
You can do this by contacting your reseller for device uploads,

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.166
using a CSV file to upload one or more devices in bulk,

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.765
or by working with a supported EMM to sync your devices with the EMM into the portal.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.999
For this video, we'll show you how resellers can upload devices.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.100
Let’s head over to the Resellers page.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.306
Knox E-FOTA helps prevent unauthorized device use by allowing your Samsung-approved resellers to upload devices.

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:20.132
But before a reseller can upload devices, you'll first need to register them.

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:22.799
To do that, click Resellers in the left pane,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.666
then click REGISTER RESELLER.

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:28.933
Enter the reseller's Knox Reseller ID in the text box and click Register.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.200
Once you register a reseller, you can also set your reseller preferences.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:38.006
With Auto-approval, you can set the devices to be auto-approved when a trusted reseller uploads them,

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.332
streamlining the entire upload process.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.702
With Auto-assignment, you can also choose a default campaign you'd like to automatically assign to

00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:46.732
devices every time a reseller uploads them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.766
Once you're done configuring your preferences, save them.

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:53.766
Next, you’ll have to approve the devices that your reseller has uploaded.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.933
Let’s head over to the Devices page.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.933
The Devices page displays every device that's been uploaded to your account.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:05.524
It also shows the firmware version these devices are running, the OS updates these devices are set up for,

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:09.405
and the status of these OS updates, alongside other device information.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.731
Note that either a trial or a commercial license is needed for device uploads into your account.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.800
To verify and approve devices uploaded by your reseller,

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:19.666
click View next to the pending upload in the UPLOADS tab,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.566
then click APPROVE ALL DEVICES.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.309
In the dialog, select whether you want to enable automatic device approval

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.466
and campaign assignment for this reseller for future device uploads.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.432
Once you're done, click APPROVE.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.585
This makes it easy to ensure that all the device uploads a particular reseller makes are swiftly approved,

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:37.866
regardless of how large the device fleet is.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:41.866
Now that you have your devices uploaded, let's talk about campaigns.

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:47.267
Knox E-FOTA campaigns let you control how different OS and firmware updates are pushed to different devices,
 
 

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:49.665
which you can classify into device groups.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.800
You can configure device groups to have different firmware installation and download periods,
 

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.366
configure network requirements,

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:56.999
and campaign rollout policies,
 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.033
all while being able to test pre-deployment app compatibility.

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:01.299
To create a campaign,

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.966
go to the Campaigns page on the left navigation pane.

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:06.099
Then, click CREATE CAMPAIGN.

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:10.962
On the campaign configuration screen, enter a campaign name and an optional description.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.400
Next, configure the campaign schedule.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:16.645
This can either be a set period with a definite start and end time,

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:19.032
or just a start date with an indefinite end time.

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:22.733
You’ll need to define a period for firmware installations on your devices.

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:25.466
Note that you can also include weekends in your schedule.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.232
Then, select a period for firmware download.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.165
This period can either be the same as the firmware installation period or any period that you customize.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:37.366
You can then set the duration for which the firmware installation messages are displayed.

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:40.466
After this duration, installation begins automatically.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.266
If needed, you can also postpone installations.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.589
Note that you can only postpone three times and will get a reminder as per the postponement duration setting.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.966
Next, select a download network.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.451
The Basic network allows you to download firmware over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or mobile data,

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.899
while the Advanced network allows you to decide the priority of these networks.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.830
This means that even if the device Wi-Fi fails, the device can still download using mobile data.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:08.947
You can also configure networks to ensure that downloads occur or are blocked only on these networks.

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:12.032
Next, you can restrict downloads to a specific size,

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.399
define a minimum battery level for installations,

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:17.166
and block the factory reset option for device users.

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:19.666
Then, enter your contact details.

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:23.432
You can manually assign a particular firmware version to your enrolled devices.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.333
To do so, first select your device model and enter the sales codes.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.566
Then, select the firmware version that’ll be applied to your device.

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:33.919
This can either be the latest firmware, the current firmware version,

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.899
or a firmware version that you select from the list of available firmware.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.833
If you select a particular firmware version, click ADD after selecting it.

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.953
Then, to select devices that’ll receive this firmware update,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.200
click ASSIGN DEVICES, select one or more devices, and click ASSIGN to finish.

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:52.499
Now, the firmware version you’ve selected will be pushed to all the devices you've selected.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:58.962
Finally, you can also optionally choose a campaign rollout policy to control how many devices download new firmware each day.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.266
Once you finish configuring the campaign policies, click CREATE AND ACTIVATE.

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:09.592
Now that you have an active campaign, we’ll show how you can assign a campaign and a firmware version to your enrolled devices.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.400
Click Devices in the left pane,

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:14.533
then select one or more devices you want to assign the campaign to.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.399
Click ACTIONS, then click Assign campaign.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.633
Select the campaign that you just created, then click ASSIGN.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.166
All the campaign details will be pushed to all the devices you selected.

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:28.475
Similarly, you can also cancel a campaign, delete a campaign,

00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:31.965
or download device information as a CSV file by clicking ACTIONS.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:34.466
Now that you’ve assigned a campaign to your device,

00:06:34.566 --> 00:06:38.099
let’s see what actually happens when the campaign updates are pushed to the device.

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:42.996
Once an active campaign is assigned to a device, the device goes through the firmware or OS update.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.844
On the device, the Knox E-FOTA client app displays information about the firmware being updated and the assigned campaign,

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.399
such as the campaign status, the campaign period,

00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:54.033
and the software download and installation conditions.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.633
As the update progresses, you can check its status on the Dashboard page.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.317
Here, the DEVICE UPDATE STATUS widget shows you if the update is completed, in progress, or yet to start.

00:07:03.866 --> 00:07:07.032
Additionally, you can check updates about your device on the Devices page,

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:09.066
such as the new OS or firmware version,

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:10.266
the operation status,

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.099
or security patch information.

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:15.332
This concludes our video on getting started with Knox E-FOTA.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.327
