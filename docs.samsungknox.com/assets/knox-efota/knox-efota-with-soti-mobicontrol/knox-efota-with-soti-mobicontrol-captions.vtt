00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:12.166
Welcome to the Knox Video Training Series.

2
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:16.066
In just a few steps, you’ll learn how to manage Samsung firmware updates using Knox E-FOTA 

3
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:22.299
directly within the SOTI MobiControl console. With Knox E-FOTA now integrated into SOTI MobiControl, 

4
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.866
managing your Samsung devices is not only easier but also smarter.

5
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:27.699
Let’s get started!

6
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.166
Before we begin, make sure you have the following ready:

7
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.032
‧A valid Knox Suite license,

8
00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.899
‧Access to Samsung Knox,

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.400
 and 
‧ A compatible Samsung device
 enrolled in your SOTI console.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.833
First, log in to the SOTI MobiControl console.

11
00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:53.833
From the main dashboard, go to Global Settings. 

12
00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:58.266
This is where you’ll find the Samsung Knox E-FOTA integration menu.

13
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:03.832
Under the Android section, select Samsung Knox E-FOTA and click Login.

14
00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:11.266
Choose Continue, then sign in with your Knox credentials. Approve the access request when prompted.

15
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:17.766
Once logged in, you’ll see a confirmation message: “Authentication Successful.”

16
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:23.266
Now your Knox E-FOTA license details and license sync options will appear.

17
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:30.999
To proceed, upload your validation certificate under Manage Notifications and click Save.

18
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.300
Manage Notifications needs to be configured so that you can see the status updates in the console.

19
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.166
enabling the 'notifications' option comes with potential security risks. 

20
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:47.866
SOTI Mobicontrol will not validate any incoming messages as it is not recommended best practice.

21
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:55.632
SOTI has created an option to do automatic device uploads for Knox E-FOTA by configuring the Auto Upload Enrolled Devices option. 

22
00:01:55.633 --> 00:02:00.366
But if you need devices to be uploaded right away there is a manual option.

23
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:07.766
Select your device, click More, and choose 'Upload Device to Knox E-FOTA'.

24
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:12.566
This requires that your device is already enrolled in the SOTI console.

25
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:16.866
Then, sync the device status to confirm the upload was successful.

26
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:24.999
If a notification certificate is already configured.
You can also just refresh the dashboard to see the changes.

27
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.333
Next, we’ll install the Knox E-FOTA agent.

28
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:34.499
You can do this either by creating an App Policy or a Profile—just choose one method.

29
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.500
For the App Policy:
Go to Policies, the Apps menu and click "NEW APP POLICY."

30
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.700
Choose Android Enterprise and enter a name for your app policy.

31
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.766
In the Apps tab, search for Knox E-FOTA in Managed Google Play and select it.

32
00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:01.699
Click the three dots next to the app and choose Configure.

33
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.300
Set the App Update Priority to High and enable “Launch App After Installation.”

34
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.966
When you’re done, click Save, then Save and Assign, and apply it to your device group.

35
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:27.966
Alternatively, to use a Profile:
Go to Profiles and click "ADD PROFILE." 

36
00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:34.266
Choose Android > Work Managed.
Enter a name and go to the "CONFIGURATIONS" tab.

37
00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:40.199
Click the plus icon, select OEMConfig, and choose Samsung.

38
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.700
In the pop-up, enable device policy controls under Device-wide Policies.

39
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:53.600
Then enable the firmware update policy options and select Enable E-FOTA client installation and Launch.

40
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.966
Click Save, assign the profile to your device group, and finish by clicking Assign.

41
00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:11.299
Now let’s confirm the agent installation on your device.

42
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:21.300
Go to Devices in the sidebar, select your device, and click the Remote Control icon.

43
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.733
Once connected, continue through the installation prompts for Knox E-FOTA.

44
00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:38.099
After installation, open the app to check that it’s enrolled correctly.

45
00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:51.632
Then, back in the SOTI console, sync the device status once again to update the view or simply refresh the dashboard

46
00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:56.499
if you have configured the notification certificate.

47
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.466
Your device should now show as enrolled in Knox E-FOTA, but with no policy applied yet.

48
00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:08.799
Now it’s time to create your firmware management policy—the Samsung Knox E-FOTA campaign.

49
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.866
Go to Policies > Firmware Management > Samsung Knox E-FOTA.

50
00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:22.532
Here you can configure settings like Basic Info, Schedule, network usage, and device condition and more.

51
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.133
Click Save and Assign, select the target devices, and click Next.

52
00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:42.133
devices are grouped based on common Model/Sales/CSC code, which helps in organized management.

53
00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.399
In the Firmware tab, choose how updates will be applied:

54
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.966
You can assign a specific version, lock the current version, always use the latest, or allow only up to a set version.

55
00:05:53.966 --> 00:06:02.632
Once selected, click OK and Assign. Your device now follows the firmware policy you just created.

56
00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:08.999
And that’s it!
Your Samsung devices are now managed with Knox E-FOTA through the SOTI console.

57
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.666
