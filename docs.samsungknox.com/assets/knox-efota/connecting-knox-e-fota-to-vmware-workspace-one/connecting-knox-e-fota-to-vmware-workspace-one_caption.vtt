00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome to the Knox video training series

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.133
In this video, we'll show you how to connect Knox E-FOTA to VMWare Workspace ONE

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:19.266
And add device groups from Workspace ONE. This lets you keep device information synchronized between the two.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.733
Let's get started!

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.733
Before you start connecting Knox E-FOTA to VMWare Workspace ONE

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:31.133
You first need to, Create a Samsung Knox account at SamsungKnox.com

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:35.133
Apply for access to Knox E-FOTA and Workspace ONE

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:40.300
Obtain trial or commercial licenses for Knox E-FOTA and Workspace ONE

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.133
And finally, prepare your Samsung devices in Workspace ONE by enrolling them and adding them to device groups

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.733
To connect Knox E-FOTA to VMWare Workspace ONE, you'll need to 

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:57.733
Create an API client in your Workspace ONE admin portal 

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:04.066
Connect to Workspace ONE through the Knox E-FOTA admin portal using your new API client's REST API key

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.333
Enroll your Workspace ONE device group in Knox E-FOTA

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:15.333
And install the Knox E-FOTA One app on the devices through Workspace ONE and Knox Service Plugin

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:21.500
To create an API client, log in to the VMWare Workspace ONE admin portal 

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.733
Go to Groups and Settings, All Settings

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:30.600
Under System, click Advanced, API, REST API

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.900
In the General tab, ensure that API access is enabled

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.566
Then click Add

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:47.900
Under Service, enter a unique name for the API key

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.333
Click Save. Take note of your new client's REST API key. 

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.900
You'll use it with Knox E-FOTA

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.633
Now that you've created an API client key, you can use it to connect Knox E-FOTA to Workspace ONE

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.700
Launch the Knox E-FOTA app

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.900
In the left navigation, select EMM Groups

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.366
Then, in the upper right portion of the screen, select Connect EMM

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:20.100
In the Pick your EMM to manage devices menu, 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.233

Then, enter the URL of your Workspace ONE admin portal 

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:42.933
Followed by /API/MDM

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:47.500
Enter your new REST API key, then click Connect

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.733
The smart groups from Workspace ONE are loaded

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:58.766
In the Add devices groups to E-FOTA screen, turn on Sync next to the device groups that you want to add to Knox E-FOTA

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.233
For this demonstration, we'll add only one device group

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.633
But you can add multiple groups at a time

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:07.900
Then click Add E-FOTA groups

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.266
The device group will be added to Knox E-FOTA with all device details synced from your Workspace ONE account 

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:20.266
Next, you need to enrol the device group you added

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:24.266
In your Knox E-FOTA admin portal, on the EMM Groups tab

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:28.433

Select the license you want to use, and click Done

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.700
Each device in the device group consumes one license seat 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.933
Enrollment will only start once you've installed the Knox E-FOTA app on the devices 

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:55.666
The Knox Deployment Program enables frictionless out of the box device enollment and configuration for enterprises 

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.566
With their existing fleet

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:01.100
The Knox Service Plugin helps you set up your compatible UEM 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.400
Hence, we'll show you how to install and launch the Knox E-FOTA app via Knox Service Plugin 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.966
