Hello and welcome to this Samsung Knox training video on getting started with Knox Configure. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.133
In this video, we’ll show you how to use Knox Configure to create a profile and customize devices.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.533
Let's get started.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:26.966
Knox Configure is a cloud-based device customization solution that enables content providers to customize and stage

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.266
Samsung devices remotely right out of the box.

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:36.399
You can configure devices with a one-time update using a Setup profile or push multiple updates over the air using a Dynamic profile.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.999
To start using Knox Configure, you’ll need a Samsung account.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:44.199
Go to samsungknox.com and sign in with your Samsung account credentials. 

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:49.033
If you don’t have a Samsung account, you can create one by clicking Enroll in the top right corner.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.132
After signing in to the Knox Admin Portal, click GET STARTED.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.466
Knox Configure is now visible in the left navigation pane.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.033
Before you can use Knox Configure, you’ll need a license key.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.699
Click&nbsp;Licenses, then click GET A LICENSE.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:08.299
If you’re just getting started with Knox Configure, you can generate a trial license to get to know the service before buying. 

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.966
Trial licenses allow you to configure up to 30 devices for up to three months.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.733
Choose either Setup or Dynamic and click&nbsp;GENERATE TRIAL LICENSE.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.566
Your trial license is created and can be viewed in the&nbsp;Licenses&nbsp;table.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:24.399
Now that you’ve got a license, let’s jump into how to create a profile.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:28.466
Click Knox Configure in the navigation pane, then click Profiles.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.133

On the Profile info page, give the profile a name and select the type of device you want to create a profile for.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:50.633
If you’re creating a phone or tablet profile, select the Device level and the Knox version of the device you want to push the profile to.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.399
Once you’re done, click CONFIGURATION MODE to move on to the next step.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:59.033
On the Configuration mode page, select the Knox Configure edition you want to use.

The Setup edition is designed for one-time device configuration,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.866
while the Dynamic edition allows you to update device profiles after initial configuration.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:11.899
If you’re creating a Dynamic edition profile, you can choose to configure your devices in ProKiosk mode,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.866
which can be used to restrict device operations and activity.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.266
If you’re configuring devices in Normal mode with Setup edition,

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:22.966
you can choose to have the Knox Configure agent uninstall itself from the device after configuration.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.433
Click ENROLLMENT INFO to move on.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.933

with your enterprise’s information as well as custom backgrounds, logos, and text.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.966
First, add your company’s name and support contact details.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:43.699

the enrollment wizard, welcome screen, and privacy policy.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.066

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:37.466
Click the setting you want to modify to open it and, if applicable, view a preview in the right pane.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.166

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.733
The icon for each setting will turn blue when it’s been enabled.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:49.133

When you’re done, save your draft or click SUMMARY to move on.

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:14.299
On the summary screen, you can review the details of the profile you’ve created in the left pane and view a preview in the right pane.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.733
Click EDIT to go back and change any of the settings you’ve configured.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:23.799
