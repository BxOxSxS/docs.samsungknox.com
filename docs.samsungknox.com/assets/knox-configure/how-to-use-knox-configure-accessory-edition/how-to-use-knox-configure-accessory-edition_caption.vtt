00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.599
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:15.233
In this video, you'll learn how to use Knox Configure: Accessory Edition. 

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.066
Let's get started!

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:24.264
Knox Configure: Accessory Edition lets enterprises create branded mobile device experiences for their end customers.

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:25.982
As an accessory provider, 

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:31.592
you can use Knox Configure to create profiles that include your branded content like custom wallpapers, 

00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:34.883
boot screen animations, themes, and apps. 

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:40.814
These profiles can then get loaded onto NFC-supported accessories like Galaxy smartphone cases, 

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:44.499
Galaxy Buds cases, key-chains, and cards. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.313
Once accessories are manufactured and distributed to your end customers,

00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:54.999
they simply use NFC on their mobile devices to begin downloading and installing your content.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.008
Before proceeding with this video, you'll need the following: 

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:05.993
A valid Samsung Knox account in order to access the Knox Admin Portal and enable the Knox Configure service.

00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:12.932
If you do not already have access, please review our video on Getting started with Knox Admin Portal before continuing. 

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.633
You'll also need a valid Knox Configure Accessory Edition license. 

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:23.373
This lets you create accessory profiles and export accessory data to a manufacturer. 

00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:25.741
If you do not already have a license, 

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:30.066
please reach out to an authorized Samsung Knox reseller to obtain one. 

00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.506
To create an accessory profile, go to the Profiles page,

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:38.332
then click CREATE NEW PROFILE then Accessory profile.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:42.103
Provide a unique profile name and optional description,

00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:45.399
then click NEXT until you reach the Enrollment Info tab. 

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:52.297
On this tab, provide a Company name, Support contact information, and Product name.

00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:56.332
These fields are mandatory for any accessory profile you create. 

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:02.710
Next, customize your profile by adding optional content like unique background colors or images,

00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:06.733
logos, welcome messages, and terms and condition statements.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.834
Under Accessory for Enrollment, click ADD ACCESSORY. 

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:15.682
In the dialog, select the accessory type that you want to associate with this profile: 

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:20.732
either phone covers and cases, NFC cards, or Galaxy Buds cases. 

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:26.099
In our example, we'll create this profile for NFC card and Buds case type accessories. 

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:32.754
Next, select the total number of accessories you intend on manufacturing using this profile.

00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:35.533
This can be any number up to 10,000.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:41.066
This number must not exceed the total number of seats included in your accessory edition license.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:46.849
In the next field, select the total number of unique devices that scan a single accessory. 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.266
For example, if you select 10, a single accessory will allow up to 10 different devices to scan and download its content. 

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.866
Click CONFIRM to close the dialog. 

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:02.369
In the License field, you'll need to enter your Accessory edition license details. 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.266
Once you enter your license key, click ADD.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:12.677
On the Configure-settings page, add your company's branded content like apps, animations, and themes. 

00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:19.165
In our example, we'll apply unique booting and shutdown animations, as well as a custom theme to our profile. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.166
Once you're finished with your profile settings, click NEXT to review, 

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:27.166
then click SUBMIT to create the profile. 

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:33.257
After you create your profile, you'll need to download its accessory UID file. 

00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:37.340
This file contains unique serial numbers and important data that

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.379
manufacturers require in order to create the accessories. 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.275
To download, go to Profiles, then on the ACCESSORY tab, 

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.165
select the accessory profile you just created.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.500
Under ACCESSORY UID FILES, click the DOWNLOAD link. 

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:55.099
A CSV file should download automatically.

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:59.136
Send this CSV file to your accessory manufacturer,

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:02.899
so they can inject the data onto the accessories during production. 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.900
Once your accessories are manufactured and distributed to your end customers,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.597
they simply need to enable NFC on their Galaxy devices to begin downloading your profiles themes,

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:17.032
animations, apps, and other branded content. 

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:22.974
On the Knox Configure console, you can see which accessories were scanned by going to  Devices,

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:24.999
then clicking the Accessories tab. 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.700
You'll see an Activated status for any accessory that was scanned by a device.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:37.532
