00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.613
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series. 

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:14.882
In this video, we’ll demonstrate how to use the Knox Asset Intelligence Security Center

00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:18.537
to identify and manage device vulnerabilities in your fleet. 

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:20.186
Let’s jump right in. 

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.239
Before you proceed with this video, 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.468
you should already be familiar with the basics of Knox Asset Intelligence and Knox E-FOTA. 

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:32.476
In particular, you should already know how to access the services, enroll devices

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:35.753
configure the dashboard, and create campaigns.

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:38.246
If you are not familiar with these concepts, 

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:41.390
please review the Getting started with Knox Asset Intelligence 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.966
and Getting started with Knox E-FOTA videos respectively before continuing. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
The Knox Asset Intelligence Security Center lets IT admins easily 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.500
track the security posture of every device in their fleet with powerful insights

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.500
like the total number of devices with vulnerabilities detected, 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.625
which devices have outdated security patches, 

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:06.632
and the total number of vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to your organization.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:11.037
Security Operations Teams, in collaboration with IT Admins, 

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:16.165
can prioritize security patching efforts based on the risks reported by the Security Center.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.964
Let’s look at how the Security Center can help enterprises address their

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:23.066
device security needs with a real-world example. 

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:29.214
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (or CVEs) are industry-recognized, 

00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:32.899
and publicly available records about a known security vulnerability. 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.439
As an IT admin or Security Operations professional, you may hear or read about a particular CVE

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.266
from a manufacturer’s tech bulletin, from newsletters, or from other related publications.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:51.119
Using the Knox Asset Intelligence Security Center, if you know a particular CVE number,

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.799
you can quickly check to see if devices in your fleet are affected.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:02:03.999
For example, CVE-2023-26076 was reported by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:09.132
to have the potential for attackers to remotely compromise a phone with no user interaction,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.766
requiring only that the attacker know the victim's phone number. 

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:20.470
By knowing the CVE number, you use the Security Center to check if this vulnerability is present in your fleet.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.072
To do this, go to the Security Center dashboard. 

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:28.423
Then on the Fleet vulnerabilities tile, click the drill-down view (&gt;) button. 

00:02:28.423 --> 00:02:28.432
On the next page, search for the CVE number. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.300
On the next page, search for the CVE number. 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.000
You'll see the total number of affected devices, 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.133
a link to the National Institute of Standards and Technology database where you can read more about the issue, 

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:48.132
and the date in which the issue was patched. This date is also known as the Security Patch Level or SPL date. 

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:55.193
If you click the link in the Affected devices column, you’ll see every device in the fleet affected by this CVE.

00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:55.199
In the table, you’ll also see the current security patch level for each effected device, 

00:02:55.266 --> 00:03:00.157
In the table, you'll also see the current security patch level for each affected device,

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:03.765
as well as the required patch level to resolve the issue.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.683
After the vulnerability is identified, 

00:03:06.683 --> 00:03:13.273
you can use Knox E-FOTA to launch an update campaign for all device models affected by that specific issue. 

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:16.440
To create an effective campaign in Knox E-FOTA, 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.657
you should take note of every unique device model in the

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:22.399
Security Center affected by the CVE.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.883
Then on the Knox E-FOTA campaign page, click CREATE CAMPAIGN. 

00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:31.563
In the section where you assign devices and firmware, select ADD MANUALLY. 

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:34.596
Select one of the affected device models from the list, 

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:39.165
then in the Firmware version drop-down, click Select from firmware list. 

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:41.602
On the Select target firmware page, 

00:03:41.603 --> 00:03:44.638
pick the required patch version for that vulnerability,

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.932
then click SELECT to add this patch to your campaign. 

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:52.442
If your fleet has more than one device model affected by the vulnerability,

00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:56.799
click ADD ANOTHER ROW and repeat the process for the remaining models. 

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:59.054
After your devices are patched, 

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:05.633
head back to the Security Center and confirm that the CVE is no longer reported for your device models. 

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:10.268
Now that you know how to use the Knox Asset Intelligence Security Center, 

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:15.432
you’re ready to take on your fleet’s device vulnerabilities more effectively and efficiently. 

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:19.299
You can learn more about the Knox Asset Intelligence Security center 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.160
and how it works by viewing our documentation at docs.samsungknox.com. 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.732
