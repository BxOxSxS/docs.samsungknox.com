00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.551
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series. 

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:16.895
In this video, we'll explain how you can use Knox Asset Intelligence to troubleshoot device issues in your fleet. 

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:18.432
Let's jump right in. 

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.913
Before you proceed with this video, 

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:26.275
you must have a valid Samsung Knox account and access to the Knox Asset Intelligence service. 

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:29.215
You must also have active devices in your account, 

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:34.099
and the devices must have the Knox Asset Intelligence agent application installed.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.000
This video is intended for users already familiar with the console. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.292
If you are new to the world of Knox Asset Intelligence, or if you need a refresher, 

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:48.866
please review our Getting started with Knox Asset Intelligence video before continuing. 

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:55.993
While Knox Asset Intelligence can help you quickly view and analyze your fleet's apps, battery, and network performance, 

00:00:55.994 --> 00:01:00.299
there may be times when you'll want to troubleshoot devices that are performing poorly.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:05.066
Knox Asset Intelligence has several tools to help troubleshoot device issues. 

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:09.680
IT admins can use the console to request debug logs and snapshots, 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.832
while end-users can launch the agent app to send error reports and view diagnostic information directly from their device.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.966
Let's take a closer look at each of these features in more detail. 

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:28.466
Diagnostic device logs provide detailed information related to a device's activities and overall operation. 

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:34.032
Once requested, these logs can be downloaded from the console for up to 30 days by default, 

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.699
after which they expire. 

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:39.310
To request a log, go to the Devices page. 

00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:41.876
Select one or more devices from the list, 

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:45.565
then click actions, Request diagnostics device log.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.100
In the pop-up window, select the type of log file you want to request. 

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:55.383
Device debug logs help you identify issues related to device apps, battery, 

00:01:55.384 --> 00:01:58.533
network connectivity, or overall operation, 

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:03.999
while TCPdump logs help you identify network traffic issues between the device and servers.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.405
By default, if you request a log, 

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:11.544
users will see a notification on their device asking them to consent to the log request. 

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:17.533
For fully managed devices, and devices operating as kiosks, you can choose to request the log silently. 

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.566
This option lets you get a log from the device without requiring the user's consent. 

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:28.577
For devices with a work profile, users will always be required to consent to the log request, 

00:02:28.578 --> 00:02:31.566
regardless of whether or not you made a silent request. 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.333
After you've chosen your log type, click CONFIRM to request the log. 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.066
An important workflow in helping IT admins troubleshoot device network related issues 

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.132
is the ability to capture TCPdump logs. 

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.582
As mentioned earlier, 

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:51.192
you can request a TCPdump log by selecting a device from the Devices page 

00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:56.099
and requesting a diagnostic device log, then choosing TCPdump log. 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.318
and requesting a diagnostic device log, then choosing TCPdump log. 

00:02:56.318 --> 00:03:03.698
Once a request is made, device users will receive a special prompt asking them to start capturing their TCPdump log.

00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:07.665
On the device side, users can tap Start Capturing. 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.433
A five-minute countdown timer appears in the top right corner of the screen. 

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:14.481
Once the timer starts, 

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:18.376
users can try to reproduce their network errors by launching any apps 

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:21.833
or performing any actions that led to the error in the first place.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:27.719
After reproducing the error, users can tap the timer window to Stop and Send the capture, 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.765
Start over, or CANCEL the capture altogether. 

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:37.466
After a log is captured from the device, you can view it by going to the Diagnostics page. 

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:42.099
On the DIAGNOSTIC LOGS tab, you'll see a history of every log request made, 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.733
along with links to download the log file for offline viewing.

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:50.633
Click the Download link in the DELIVERY column to review the log in more detail.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.200
Snapshots provide a detailed summary of your device's status and settings, 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.294
as well as helpful diagnostic information related to your fleet's app usage, network strength, and battery status.

00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:09.438
However, unlike with logs, snapshots can't be downloaded for offline viewing or analysis. 

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:12.566
They are meant to be viewed only from within the console. 

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:16.095
To request a Snapshot, go to the Devices page, 

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:20.944
then select a device and click ACTIONS, followed by Request device snapshot. 

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:27.099
If the device is online, a snapshot will be collected without requiring any user interaction.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:31.577
While you can manually make a snapshot request at any time, 

00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:37.233
there may be times when you'll want to schedule a snapshot to happen automatically, after an event occurs. 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.232
To schedule a device snapshot to occur after an event, select a device, 

00:04:42.232 --> 00:04:45.566
then click ACTIONS, Schedule device snapshot. 

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:48.399
Select the snapshot criteria. 

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:54.666
If you want to also collect an optional debug log, choose this option here, then click CONFIRM. 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.059
After a snapshot is captured from the device, 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.174
you can view it by going to the SNAPSHOTS tab on the Diagnostics page. 

00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:05.494
Here, you'll see a history of every snapshot request made, 

00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:10.499
along with links to view the snapshot report and download the optional debug log file.

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.608
If you have any scheduled snapshots pending,

00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:19.932
you can click the MANAGE SCHEDULED SNAPSHOTS button to review, modify, or delete these requests. 

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:26.033
The Knox Asset Intelligence agent application allows end users to view the status of their devices, 

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:29.966
monitor app, battery, and network diagnostic information,

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:34.232
and send error reports back to their IT admins for further troubleshooting.

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:37.866
By tapping anywhere in the Device status field, 

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:43.336
users can view device information like firmware and OS version, security patch levels, 

00:05:43.337 --> 00:05:46.032
available storage and memory, and more.

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:54.224
To view app, battery, or network diagnostic information, tap any button in the Diagnostics field. 

00:05:54.225 --> 00:06:00.032
In our example, let's tap Apps to take a look at our device's app diagnostic information. 

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:03.466
On the following screen, we can see helpful information like 

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:06.899
the top 5 apps with the highest battery or network consumption, 

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:11.419
as well as any apps which reported events like App Not Responding, 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.932
Force Close, or Abnormal behavior. 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.018
From here, if we want to send an error report back to the IT admin for further troubleshooting,

00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:23.565
we can tap Error report in the top right corner of the screen. 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The Error reports screen will pre-populate with App in the header field. 

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:33.533
Provide additional details about the error in the text field below, then tap Send.

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:37.766
You can also send an error report from the app's home screen by tapping 

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:41.599
"Send error report" and selecting an error category.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.436
