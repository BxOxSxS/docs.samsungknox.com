00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:10.105
Hello, and welcome to the Knox video training series. 

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:15.132
In this video, we’ll show you how to get started with using Knox Asset Intelligence.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.399
 
Let's begin.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.522
Knox Asset Intelligence is a cloud-based data analytics solution

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:27.465
that turns your fleet’s daily device-usage information into actionable business insights.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.699
Before you can use Knox Asset Intelligence, you'll need the following:

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.432
You must have a Samsung Knox account. 

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:38.177
If you do not have one, please go to Samsungknox.com

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:42.899
and click GET STARTED to create an account before proceeding with this video. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.900
You’ll need Samsung devices running a supported Knox version. 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.900
Depending on your device model, this version may differ. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.608
To see which devices are supported, as well as their required Knox versions, 

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:57.418
go to Samsungknox.com,

00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:00.399
then select Solutions &gt; Knox devices. 

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.099
On the next page, select Knox Asset Intelligence to view the list of supported devices.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.933
On the next page, select Knox Asset Intelligence to view the list of supported devices.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.778
Please note that certain device models are only partially-supported, 

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:15.165
meaning that they don’t work with all Knox Asset Intelligence features. 

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.794
For a list of partially-supported devices and what features they support or don’t support, 

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.744
For a list of partially-supported devices and what features they support or don’t support, 

00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:24.699
please refer to our Knox Asset Intelligence documentation.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.132
You’ll also need a valid Knox Suite license.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.981
To learn more about the Knox Suite license, 

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:35.499
please review our video on getting started with Knox Suite.

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:43.733
To use Knox Asset Intelligence, you’ll need devices uploaded to your console. 

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:47.117
There are several ways to get devices uploaded to your console:

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:52.555
through a Samsung approved reseller, 
or by manually uploading them with a CSV file. 

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:56.933
To upload devices into Knox Asset Intelligence through a reseller, 

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.933
you’ll first need to obtain your reseller’s Knox Reseller ID. 

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:06.874
Once you have that, go to the Resellers page, then click REGISTER RESELLER. 

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:12.933
On the next page, enter the Reseller ID and click LOOK UP, then click REGISTER. 
 

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:17.937
Once you’ve registered the reseller, provide them with your Knox Customer ID

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.932
so they can upload devices directly to your account. 

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:25.166
You can find your Customer ID on the Reseller page. 

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:29.518
To manage reseller preferences, click the reseller name. 

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:34.959
Here you can select whether you want to auto-approve all devices uploaded by this reseller, 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.212
and whether you want to automatically enroll all devices uploaded by this reseller 

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:41.865
when devices are turned on for the first time.

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:47.547
Once the reseller uploads your devices, they’ll appear on the Devices page. 

00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:50.866
Click the UPLOADS tab to view the upload details. 

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:57.371
If you previously set your reseller preferences to auto approve all devices, 

00:02:57.372 --> 00:03:02.866
the devices will show up on the main tab with a Not enrolled status. 

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:09.328
If you want to upload devices to the Knox Asset Intelligence service without a reseller,

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.254
you can do so by using a CSV file.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:16.621
Simply prepare a CSV file containing your device IMEI numbers, 

00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:21.899
then head to the Device page, 
click ACTIONS, then Upload devices.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.142
Locate your CSV file and click SUBMIT.

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:31.599
If the upload was successful, the devices will appear in the main tab with a Not enrolled status. 

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:38.724
After devices are uploaded to your console, you’ll need to ensure that they are communicating with the server. 

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:43.315
For this to happen, devices need to be enrolled into the Knox Asset Intelligence service.

00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:46.452
There are two ways to enroll devices: 

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:51.932
The first way is to have devices automatically enroll after they get uploaded by a reseller.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:55.933
As previously mentioned, to enroll with this method, 

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:59.193
go to the Resellers page, select the reseller's name, 

00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:01.665
then enable the auto-enrollment option.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:06.170
When a new or factory-reset device is turned on for the first time, 

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.001
and the user goes through its initial setup, 

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.959
the Knox Asset Intelligence agent will install,

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.432
and the device will automatically enroll into Knox Asset Intelligence. 

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:21.742
The second way is to install the Knox Asset Intelligence agent as a managed

00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:25.199
 application using an EMM. 

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:33.484
After devices are enrolled into the Knox Asset Intelligence service,

00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:37.299
they will show as Active status in the Devices page. 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.366
Now that your devices are enrolled, you can start using the Asset Intelligence Dashboard, 

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:47.566
Here is where you’ll find at-a-glance views of your device fleet’s health and performance, 

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:50.566
organized into easy-to-use tiles.

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:55.866
By default, the main dashboard displays all of your insights together in one consolidated view.

00:04:55.866 --> 00:05:00.299
In the navigation pane, several sub-dashboards are also available. 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.978
These sub-dashboards provide the same business insights as the main dashboard, 

00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:09.620
but grouped into different insight categories like Apps, Battery, and Network, 

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:12.833
to help you analyze data more quickly and efficiently. 

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:19.366
While the Dashboard is ready to use without any additional setup, some features are not enabled by default.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.207
Let’s take a look at some of the key Dashboard settings so that we can get the most out of our fleet’s data.

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:30.266
To configure your dashboard settings, go to the Dashboard page, then click the Settings button.

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:35.799
The DATA CONDITIONS tab allows you to define when and how data gets collected, 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.700
and what type of data gets collected by the Knox Asset Intelligence service.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.100
By default, Knox Asset Intelligence collects data at all times (if data is available). 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.035
However, if you want to only collect data at certain times or under certain conditions,

00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:53.032
then you can enable the Work shift configuration option.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.842
For example, if you want to only collect device-usage data from 9-6 PM on weekdays,
 

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:03.832
or only collect data when devices are connected to ca ertain Wi-Fi access point

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:08.133
or using certain applications, then you can enable one of these options here. 

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:12.466
The Data upload section lets you specify what type of data gets collected, 

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:16.266
and (for some insights) how often data gets collected.

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:21.466
Use the toggle button to enable or disable data collection for that particular insight, 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.300
or use the checkboxes to select the type of insight data you want to collect.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.541
In the CUSTOMIZE tab, you can define which insights appear on your main dashboard. 

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:36.494
Simply pick the insights you want to add or remove from the main dashboard. 

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:43.344
Note that some insights like Device statuses and Today’s issues cannot be removed from the main dashboard.

00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:47.909
In the THRESHOLDS tab, you can define the conditions in which alerts are triggered. 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.675
For example, if you are interested in knowing how much mobile network data your apps consume, 

00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:56.669
but are only concerned when your apps consume more than 10MB per day, 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.820
then you can set this Threshold value in the APP section. 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.218
In the NETWORK tab, you can decide whether you want to collect network usage data for all Wi-Fi access points, 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:08.448
or for only specific access points.

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.930
If your device-fleet frequently communicates with a server, 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.033
you can collect network latency data to analyze how long it takes for your devices to get a response from that server.

00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:21.032
And finally, In the MANAGED APPS tab, 

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:24.647
you can categorize apps as unmanaged or managed,

00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:28.790
letting you easily filter out unwanted insights on the dashboard. 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.943
By default, all apps are considered unmanaged.

00:07:31.944 --> 00:07:39.632
But if you specify certain applications as managed, you’ll be able to get insights for only those apps on the Dashboard.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.487
Once you’re done configuring your Dashboard settings, click SAVE.

00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:49.865
Now that we’ve configured our Dashboard, let’s take a quick tour of the Dashboard itself and explore some of its features.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.562
The Device statuses tile is where you can see how many devices you have in the Knox Asset Intelligence console, 

00:07:56.562 --> 00:08:00.866
and how many of those devices are enrolled and actively reporting data to the server.

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:08.031
Next to the Device Statuses tile, the Today’s issues tile gives you a summary of the top issues in your fleet.

00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:12.247
You can use this information to identify the problematic devices in your fleet

00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:17.014
(for example, which devices had the most app crashes or Wi-Fi disconnections) 

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:21.165
so that you can quickly troubleshoot and help reduce fleet downtime.

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:25.049
You can configure how your dashboard appears. 

00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:28.694
These two tiles are in a fixed position on the Dashboard. 

00:08:28.694 --> 00:08:35.432
However, for all other tiles, you can arrange them in any order by simply clicking and dragging them into position. 

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:45.499
In the top ribbon, you’ll find the date selector. Use this to select the period for which you want to view data.

00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:50.110
Note that some dashboard tiles are denoted with a Today indicator, 

00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:56.722
letting you know that data is only available for the current day, regardless of the reporting period selected.
 

00:08:56.722 --> 00:09:00.993
Let’s look at how data is organized in the Dashboard.

00:09:00.994 --> 00:09:05.499
Each business insight is presented in a main dashboard “Tile”. 

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500
You can think of the main tile as a quick summary of the insight.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.956
For most tiles, you can get an Expanded view for that insight,

00:09:12.956 --> 00:09:16.132
allowing you to analyze your fleet’s data in greater detail.

00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:21.034
For example, the main tile view for Apps with highest battery consumption 

00:09:21.034 --> 00:09:26.186
summarizes the top 5 apps that have the highest battery consumption in your fleet.

00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:28.827
But when you click the Expanded view button, 
 

00:09:28.827 --> 00:09:33.932
you’ll see battery consumption for all apps in the fleet, not just the top 5.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.226
While Expanded view data differs for each insight, 

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:42.398
most expanded-view pages generally follow a similar structure. 

00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:47.088
On most pages, you’ll see a chart summarizing the top issues, apps, or devices, 
 

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:50.766
and a table displaying all available data for that insight.

00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:55.818
Note that some insights (like Wi-Fi disconnection events) 
 

00:09:55.818 --> 00:09:59.299
summarize their top issues in a table instead of a chart.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.633
On most expanded view pages, you can use the filter button to narrow your results, 

00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:08.499
customize the columns in the data table, 

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.066
and download the data as a CSV file for further analysis. 

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:19.599
For some insights, you can get an even deeper analysis of the data with a drill-down view.

00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:26.433
You can access the Drill-down view for most insights by clicking any link in the Expanded view page’s data table.

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:31.643
For example, if we go back to the Expanded view for Apps with highest battery consumption, 

00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:36.933
you’ll see that you can drill down further by clicking any value in the APP column in the data table. 

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:44.233
If we click Knox Service Plugin in our example, we’ll see a drill-down view of this application,

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:48.878
Just like with the expanded view page, most drill-down pages

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:53.833
allow you to also download the drill-down data in a CSV file for further analysis.

00:10:54.766 --> 00:11:00.666
Note that for most insights, you can also access the drill-down view from the insight’s main tile. 

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:05.739
This is a quick way of seeing the drill-down information for an insight’s top issues. 

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.166
without going to the Expanded view.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200
This wraps up our beginner walkthrough of Knox Asset Intelligence. 

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.372
You should now be ready to upload and enroll devices, 

00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:22.200
and begin using the Dashboard to start viewing your fleet’s health and status information.

00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:26.997
