you can quickly and easily upload devices to a customer’s Knox account in bulk,

using the Knox Reseller Portal.

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:14.138
Before you begin, you’ll need the following:

A Knox partner account and access to the partner portal.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.834

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:24.266
go to partner.samsungknox.com and sign up before continuing.

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.099
You'll also need your customer’s Knox ID.

selecting the upload ID, then clicking ACTIONS, Delete device upload.
