00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.232
Hello and welcome to the Knox video training series.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.076
In this video, we'll show you how to begin using Knox Authentication Manager. Let’s get started!

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:18.811
Knox Authentication Manager is an application that lets your enterprise front line workers

00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:22.712
pick up any device in the fleet, sign in using facial recognition, 

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.394
and launch their apps without signing in each time. 

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.984
By the end of this video, you'll learn how to add and configure Knox Authentication Manager in your UEM, 

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:33.911
deploy Knox Authentication Manager to your devices,  

00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:37.685
and use Knox Authentication Manager as an end-user.

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:40.907
While Knox Authentication Manager works with 4 UEMs,

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:45.078
this video will explain the deployment process using Samsung Knox Manage.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:49.657
Before you start using Knox Authentication Manager, you’ll need the following: 

00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:51.803
A valid Samsung Knox account.

00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:57.175
If you do not already have one, please go to samsungknox.com and click Get started to register. 

00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:59.556
A valid Knox Suite license. 

00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:03.116
You can watch our Getting started with Knox Suite video for more information.

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:09.366
Knox Authentication Manager requires a network that allows devices to communicate with one another

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:15.366
via Wi-Fi and reach Google Firebase. Both of these features are needed in order to coordinate device syncing.
 

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:22.366
Additionally, Knox Authentication Manager is only compatible with select Samsung devices running Android 12 or higher.

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.032
See the admin guide for more details.

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:30.299
To use Knox Authentication Manager, you’ll need an account with one of following UEMs: 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.100
Knox Manage, VMware Workspace ONE, Microsoft Intune, or SOTI MobiControl.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.700
If you use SOTI MobiControl or Knox Manage, you’ll also need a Microsoft Azure Directory account.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.233
Additionally, each UEM needs to be setup (in its own way) to work with Knox Authentication Manager on devices:

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.466
VMware uses the VMware Workspace ONE launcher,

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.432
Intune uses the Microsoft Managed Home screen,

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:57.166
Knox Manage sets devices in kiosk mode,

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:02.132
and SOTI sets devices in Lockdown, which is similar to the Knox Manage kiosk mode.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:08.616
If you use SOTI or Knox Manage, you’ll first need to add Knox Authentication Manager to your Azure portal.

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:12.491
Sign into your Azure portal and click on Azure Active Directory.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:15.899
Next, go to App registrations and click on New registration.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.966
Next, go to App registrations and click on New registration.

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:22.757
You can simply enter a display name, ignore the default settings, and click Register.

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:22.965
On the next page, go to Authentication.

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:25.466
On the next page, go to Authentication.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:25.632
Once you’ve selected Android as a platform, see our admin guide to copy the package name and hash for Knox Authentication Manager. 
 

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:32.166
Once you’ve selected Android as a platform, see our admin guide to copy the package name and hash for Knox Authentication Manager. 
 

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:40.899
Click Configure, then Done. You’re now finished adding Knox Authentication Manager to your Azure portal.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.900
While you’re in your Azure portal, you can grab your tenant ID and client ID,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.300
which you’ll need when you’re setting the managed configuration for Knox Authentication Manager.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.300
For your tenant ID, navigate to Azure Active Directory and you’ll see your tenant ID in the page that opens.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.533
Copy it to a notepad for later.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:05.966
For the application ID, go to App registrations and copy your client ID from beside where Knox Authentication Manager is listed.
 

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:13.533
Now you can switch to your UEM console. Next, we’re going to add Knox Authentication Manager as a managed app.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:21.533
In Knox Manage, navigate to Application and click Add. Select Android and Public-Managed Google Play, and then click Next.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:26.066
Search for Knox Authentication Manager using the search bar and click Select.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.300
Now click Save and Assign.

00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:33.733
Next, you’ll need to set the Knox Authentication Manager managed configuration.

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:37.733
On the Assign Application page click Set Configuration. 
 

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:42.233
In this video, we’ll only cover the settings you need to get started with Knox Authentication Manager.

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:50.466
The rest of the settings you can leave as default or change as needed. Click on each section to expand its settings.

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:54.966
This first section is Enable Knox Authentication Manager policy controls,

00:03:54.966 --> 00:04:01.832
which deals with basic settings such as inputting your Knox Suite license. First, set a name for your Managed Configuration.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.700
Next, enter your Knox Suite license key. If you have your Knox Admin Portal open, you can find this in the Licenses section.
 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.891
The next section is Manage Login controls, which sets how users sign-in to their shared device sessions:

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:24.349
First, select the main login app for your UEM. For Knox Manage, select Other-Kiosk Mode.

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:30.807
Next, select how you want users to sign-in to their shared device session, by face or manually.

00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:34.231
Manual sign-in gets users to enter their enterprise credentials

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:38.284
while face sign in gets users to enter a PIN number and scan their face.

00:04:38.284 --> 00:04:41.932
In this video, we’ll show you how face-sign in works.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.696
The next section is Manage Kiosk Mode controls.

00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:51.199
This section is only necessary to fill if you’re using Knox Manage or SOTI.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.200
In the fields below, paste your tenant ID as well as your client ID

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.166
that you copied from your Azure portal earlier.

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:04.057
The last section is Manage Sync controls which controls how devices sync.

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:09.916
First, enter the org ID. This defines how your devices are organized in your fleet.
 

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:15.937
Next, decide whether your devices will sync when they have the same group ID or when they’re on the same Wi-Fi subnet.

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:21.166
If you chose group ID, enter a group ID and a sync group key in the rows below.

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:27.166
You can generate a 32 digit sync key by entering the command you see on screen into a terminal on your computer.

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:34.533
Once you’re finished, save the configuration, add Knox Authentication Manager to a group, and click Assign.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:43.333
Now you can head back to Applications and add any other apps that you want users to use alongside Knox Authentication Manager.

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:47.166
We’re going to add Google Chrome and Microsoft teams.

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:53.851
The first step if you use SOTI or Knox Manage, is to create a Kiosk or Lockdown home screen. 

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:59.766
Navigate to Kiosk, click Add, select Multiple App Kiosk, and then click Next. 

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:05.788
Give your kiosk a name and add Knox Authentication Manager and any other apps you want users to have access to. 

00:06:05.788 --> 00:06:09.299
Click Save and you’re now finished creating a kiosk. 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.219
Next, we’re going to create a profile. Before you do that, 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:19.471
go to Applications and copy Knox Authentication Manager’s package name.
 You’ll need this for your profile settings.

00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:25.299
Head to Profile and click Add. Give your profile a name, select Android Enterprise as your platform,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.900
and click Save and set policy.

00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:31.046
Go to Kiosk to set your kiosk settings.

00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:34.868
Under Kiosk App Settings, select Multi Apps Mode.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:44.732
Next, click on the Samsung Knox policies and scroll down to the Knox Service Plugin policies.

00:06:46.627 --> 00:06:51.030
We’re going to set two policies which will ensure that the Knox Authentication Manager app

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.593
is always running on shared devices across user sessions.

00:06:54.594 --> 00:06:58.283
In the search bar, you can search for the package name for the auto launch policy

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.852
which will auto launch Knox Authentication Manager.

00:07:00.852 --> 00:07:04.940
Enter the Knox Authentication Manager package name you just saved.

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.639
The next policy is Force stop blocklist,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.338
which will stop users from force stopping Knox Authentication Manager.

00:07:12.338 --> 00:07:20.067
Enter the package name again. Your profile settings are all done. Click Save and Assign, select a group to add the profile to,

00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:22.533
then click Assign and Apply.

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:26.533
Now that you've set Knox Authentication Manager in your UEM, 

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:29.919
confirm that Knox Authentication Manager is deployed to your devices.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.854
Switch over to a device and see that it and your other apps were successfully deployed.

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:40.908
This next section of the video will guide you through how a user would register an account with Knox Authentication Manager.

00:07:40.908 --> 00:07:45.740
You may need to click on Knox Authentication Manager and download it from Google Play. 

00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:48.402
Once it’s downloaded, you can open the app.

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:54.459
Click Sign in or enroll. On the dialog, enter your enterprise username. 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.148
On the next screens, you’ll have to re-enter your enterprise username and enter your password. 

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:03.959
Once you’ve signed in, you’ll receive a pop up asking if you’ll let Knox Authentication Manager

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:09.393
use the Google Accessibility Service API to capture sign-in information. Tap Allow. 

00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:15.966
The next pop up will ask you if you consent to having Knox Authentication Manager collect and store your biometric data.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.795
Select the radio button and tap I Accept. You’ll be asked to enter and then re-enter a PIN number.

00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:24.899
Then, you’ll be asked to scan your face. 

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:31.999
After this, there’s one more step. Go to any of your apps that require manual sign into. Sign into them.

00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:38.066
When Knox Authentication Manager asks if you’d like to save your sign-in information for that app, tap Save.

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:42.810
Go back to Knox Authentication Manager and click the lines in the top left. 

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:43.332
Under Manage credentials, you’ll see the app that you saved your credentials for. 

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:47.433
Under Manage credentials, you’ll see the app that you saved your credentials for. 

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:52.289
You’re now finished registering for Knox Authentication Manager.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:59.699
To sign out of Knox Authentication Manager if you use SOTI or Knox Manage, head to the app and tap Sign out on the home screen.

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:05.472
For VMware and Intune, you can sign out by closing your UEM launcher. 

00:09:05.473 --> 00:09:11.093
Once you’re finished using a device for the day, you should always sign out so that it can properly sync with others.
 

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:15.757
The next time you sign into Knox Authentication Manager, your sign-in will be much faster.

00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:21.211
Unlock your device or click on the Knox Authentication Manager app to pop up the sign in prompt.

00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:27.299
Enter your enterprise username and click Next. Now you can enter your PIN and scan your face to authenticate.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.750
Open the app or apps that you saved your credentials for

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.733
and Knox Authentication Manager will automatically fill in your information and sign you in.
Now we’ll show you how to test device syncing. Sign out of the first device. We’ll call that device A. 
 

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:43.053
Now we’ll show you how to test device syncing. Sign out of the first device. We’ll call that device A. 
 

00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:49.899
Grab another device with Knox Authentication Manager installed that’s under the same organization and group ID as device A.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:56.905
We’ll call this one Device B. Make sure the previous user is signed out of Device B and plug in or dock the device.

00:09:56.905 --> 00:10:04.799
Plug in or dock device A as well. Once the devices have been charging for 1-2 minutes pick up device B and sign in.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:18.000
Knox Authentication Manager should automate your sign-in and you should be able to log in to any apps without re-entering your credentials.
 

00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:24.941
This concludes our video on getting started with Knox Authentication Manager.

00:10:24.942 --> 00:10:30.194
