                                <h3>EAP for wearable devices</h3>
                                <p>Prior to this release, customers were unable to deploy wearable devices in areas where enterprise Wi-Fi was required for internal communication. Customers have requested to connect to a staging profile, deploy a profile, exit Kiosk mode on the wearable, authenticate into an Enterprise Wi-Fi (EAP-PEAP), pull-down a certificate, then re-deploy a Kiosk supported profile. However, this is not practical for deployments supporting thousands of wearable devices.</p>
                                <p>With this release, admins can now create a profile and set its Advanced Wi-Fi setting’s security type to 802.1x EAP (using either PEAP or TTLs).</p>
                                <p>Admins can assign this profile to target devices to configure the deployment area’s access point (AP) resource with 802.1x EAP as a hidden state to enable Wi-Fi connectivity for configured devices.</p>
                                <p>This feature provides the ability to simultaneously provision a large number of EAP Wi-Fi supported wearable devices in for time and cost savings.</p>
                                <div class="callout warning"><b>NOTE</b> — The following Advanced Wi-Fi setting security type is not yet supported in this release: TTLS + NONE, and TTLS + GTC</div>
                                <h3>Download profile summary as a PDF</h3>
                                <p>With this release, an authenticated user can now download profile summary settings as a PDF to easily review settings and to conveniently use the output to create profiles in other accounts.</p>
                                <p>The PDF output closely resembles the KC profile summary page that displays once a profile is configured and saved.</p>

                                <h3>Reassign devices to current license after renewal</h3>
                                <p>To date, when a Knox Configure license expires, a profile is unassigned from its assigned device. However, customers often want to renew their existing license used by deployed devices, but when the license is renewed, customers are unable to re-assign their devices. Additionally, when an unassigned device is assigned a profile using a renewed license, the devices are consuming new seats even though they have activated the license before.</p>
                                <p>As part of this release, devices will no longer consume new license seats when re-assigned to profiles under the same license. However, devices will need to be manually re-assigned the license within the KC console. This feature enables customers to re-assign their unassigned devices to a provile and reuse the renewed license without consuming additional license seats for cost savings and efficiency.</p>

                                <h3>Booting animation enhancements</h3>
                                <p>Currently, when deselecting the <b>Set a custom booting animation</b> option on a profile, the existing booting animation and sound are not cleared as expected from the wearable device when an update is pushed to the device.</p>
                                <p>The same expectation should occur when deselecting the <b>Set a custom shutdown animation</b> option on a profile: The shutdown animation and sound should be cleared when an update is pushed to the device.</p>
                                <p>To date, WKC checks if an existing animation was set by a previous WKC profile, and will not remove the animation if it was set for a previous profile. To remedy this, users now have the ability to remove booting or shutdown animation separately when pushing an update.</p>
                                <p>

                                <p>To date, when a profile is assigned and a wearable device has 15% power or less remaining, enrollment stops during the authentication stage after accepting the End User License Agreement (EULA).</p>
                                <p>Once the wearable device is charged and rebooted, the device is expected to resume enrollment. However, enrollment doesn’t resume if Power Saving mode is enabled, even if it was disabled just before license activation.</p>
                                <p>To prevent enrollment disruptions, Power Saving mode is now automatically disabled at the start of enrollment and enabled again after license activation.</p>
                                <h3>Auto select newly uploaded apps</h3>
                                <p>To date, in order to deploy an app that’s been recently uploaded into a profile, you would need to select the app manually from the app list after it’s been uploaded.</p>
                                <p>As part of this release, newly uploaded apps are now auto selected to enhance the app deployment work flow.</p>
                                <h3>Dashboard widget UI enhancements</h3>
                                <p>As part of a UI enhancement in this release, when an account has no profiles, the dashboard displays a <b>Create profile</b> button instead of the profile widgets. Selecting it starts the profile creation screen flow.</p>
                                <p>If there are profiles in the account, a <b>Select profile to pin here</b> button is displayed. Selecting enables the user to pin profiles for quick access from the dashboard.</p>

                                <p>Updated strings have been enhanced to include meaningful messages to assist with troubleshooting. For example, if an event has an error log entry associated with it, the log will include a link with additional information.</p>
                                <h3>Unable to select KDA&#160;licenses before activation date</h3>
                                <p>Currently, during profile creation, you won’t be able to select the Knox Deployment App (KDA) license key is entered if the date of entry is before the set activation date.</p>
                                <p>As part of an update in this release, the license drop-down menu will now include applicable licenses: Both active with remaining seats, as well as licenses that have yet to start. </p>
                                <p>If a user tries to use KDA to enroll a device with a license prior to the activation date, a license error code is displayed for the device user.</p>

                                <p>For example, in Setup to Dynamic, Dynamic to Setup, Setup to Setup, and Dynamic to Dynamic profile changes.</p>
                                <p>Note that if a Per Seat license is being used, a push command is sent out once the device is unassigned from its previous profile.</p>

                                <p>To date, when an event was administrated by a Samsung Admin, both the names: <b>Samsung Administrator</b> and <b>Samsung Knox Team</b> were displayed within the activity log. This inconsistency raised the question whether there are two different admin types. </p>

                                <p>To remedy this situation, the user must consent to the deletion within a pop-up message. However, if there any default profiles selected for deletion, a message displays stating they cannot be deleted since they have already been uploaded by the listed reseller.</p>

                                <h3>"Per Device Staggered" license for Setup edition profiles </h3>
                                <p>This release offers admins the option to enable the new Per Device staggered license feature.</p>
                                <p>Once the feature is selected, admins can create a Setup edition profile and assign devices before activating a Setup edition license. Once each device is activated, each license expiration date will depend on the device's activation date. </p>
                                <p>This feature addresses customer concerns to only activate a Setup edition license once each device is actually activated. This enables customers to utilize licenses more efficiently, since a customer may not initially use Knox Configure after it is purchased, or deploy devices at the same time.</p>
                                <p>Note that feature  availability will vary per country. Existing KC SKUs will be kept as is, and are not immediately impacted by this change. Official notice will be shared with KC console users via email and console notifications two weeks prior to this release.</p>

                                <p>New to Knox Configure is the ability to revoke a license on one device for reallocation to another device.</p>
                                <p> This new feature improves license provisioning efficiency with the Dynamic edition profile by utilizing the revoked licenses to increase the available license count. </p>
                                <p>Note that feature  availability will vary per country. Existing KC SKUs will be kept as is, and are not immediately impacted by this change.

                                <p>To date, creating a profile required an assigned license. With this release, profile creation and license assignment are no longer linked. Each device will now follow the behaviour of their individually assigned license type. </p>
                                <p>This new feature allows legacy licenses and new licenses to be used concurrently in the same profile, or if necessary, a profile can be created and saved without assigning a license.</p>
                                <h3>Knox Deployment App (KDA) license enhancement</h3>
                                <p>With this release, admins who are using KDA to enroll devices now have the option of explicitly assigning a license for KDA at profile creation.</p>

                                <p>This feature allows admins to specify the use of only KDA  for Bluetooth enrolments, without accessing the Knox Configure console. </p>
                                <p>To do this, admins are required to log into KDA to choose a Knox Configure Cloud service, select a profile, pair the admin device to the target device, and assign the profile to the target device.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, admins can give permission to allow access to KDA to enroll into Knox Configure directly using KDA.</p>
                                <h3>Admins now capable of being invited to multiple services</h3>
                                <p>An enhancement to Knox Configure now includes the ability to specify <b>Administrative privileges</b>.To date, admins were unable to invite admins from a different Knox Cloud Service. </p>

                                <p>With this release, a Super Admin or Admin with a <b>Manage role</b> privilege can now invite another admin from a different service to a role in their service. For example, an admin for KC can invite another admin from KME. Note that existing admins without a <b>Manage role</b> permission are restricted to only inviting admins with a matching set of their own role permission. For example, a non-super admin won't be able to invite a Super admin from another service if they don't currently have Super admin permissions.</p>

                                <p>This release introduces a new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to the KC service specifically, the Super Admin role cuts across all supported services.</p>
                                <p>With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service.</p>
                                <p>The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available.

                                <p>To date, customers have requested a feature to allow IT admins to push a reboot/factory reset command from the Knox&#160;Configure portal. With this release, IT&#160;admins can push the reboot/factory reset command  from the KC portal to specified devices  or as a bulk action using csv files. Upon successful reboot or reset, the IT admin will be notified through the KC portal that a reboot or reset has been successful. Note that the reboot push command feature can be triggered  without requiring the device user's consent. </p>

                                <p>IT admins can now maintain profile configurations assigned to wearable devices using Knox Configure, while device users can switch between without phone connection (WPC) mode and companion mode. Additionally, a profile can be configured on the wearable device while connected to the phone. This feature maintains the device configuration during a mode change, and the companion mode configuration, so device users can use their configured wearable device with the phone connection.</p>

                                <p>This enhancement enables an IT admin or system integrator to push an updated profile or application to Samsung  Gear wearable devices without any related UI displaying on the target device. This enables the wearable device user to continue to use their device without interruption, as profile or application updates occur in the background.</p>

                                <p>This feature enables an IT admin to configure a list of applications that cannot be uninstalled by the device user post enrollment and deployment. Removing an application from the disallow uninstall app list removes the uninstall restriction, and provides the device user the capability to remove the application from their device. If utilizing a setup edition profile, just a single application is permitted in the uninstall prevention list.</p>
                                <h3>Dynamic profile updates and management</h3>
                                <p>This enhancement enables an IT admin to assign a new profile to devices already having an assigned profile. If a device is configured with an old profile, a push notification for a profile update is delivered and the device can updated with a new profile. The device’s status updates to "Update pushed" and then moves to "Configured" once the updated configuration is applied to the device. The transition from the old profile to the new profile is seamless. If the new profile has different profile information (company, email, and phone number etc.), it should be processed on the target device without disruption. Additionally, if the old profile is utilizing a ProKiosk mode setting, the device exits ProKiosk mode and is re-configured based on the settings of the new profile.</p>
                                <h3>Application deployment improvements</h3>
                                <p>To date, if an application does not support a Gear S3LTE (R765) model wearable device, the wearable Knox Configure back-end returns an invalid package error. To broaden the list of supported wearable devices the Gear S3 BT or Gear Sports are now also included, so an IT admin can add a wearable application for those devices as well.</p>
                                <h3>New profile push policies supported</h3>
                                <p>To date, if a wearable device’s assigned profile is changed, a profile push update occurs regardless of the profile’s edition. New rules are now in place to restrict setup edition profiles from receiving a push update. A dynamic profile can still push update another dynamic edition profile, and a setup edition profile can push update a dynamic edition profile. However, a setup edition profile can no longer update another setup edition profile, nor can a dynamic edition profile push update a setup edition profile.</p>

With this enhancement, an IT admin can selected individual devices for push updates from the portal’s PROFILES tab or at the time of profile modification. This helps admins update just those specific devices intended to receive a specific update and exclude those devices that do not need to receive the updates.</p>

With this release, the FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a new 5-second timer under them to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input after the 5-second countdown, the wearable device screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. This feature reduces the labor required with large deployment profile pushes, where the FINISH or RESTART button must be selected on each wearable device.</p>

To satisfy this request, the wearable device’s FINISH button remains as it is today, but a new 5-second timer displays under it. If there is no input from user for 5 seconds, the device automatically moves to its home screen. In ProKiosk mode, a message will display stating the wearable device will restart in 5 seconds, then reboot automatically. </p>

                                <h3>Wearable KC support</h3>
                                <p>A new version of Knox Configure is now available that is specifically designed for Samsung Gear Sport wearable devices. KC for wearable devices utilizes the Setup and Dynamic editions available with traditional Knox Configure, as well as numerous KC features unique to wearable devices and watch face applications. </p>

                                <p>KC for wearable devices should be attractive to B2B customers who would like to adopt smart solutions to enhance performance, beyond the existing Knox Tizen SDK for Gear devices.</p>
                                <h3>Added customer feedback mechanism into KC portal</h3>
                                <p>To better support the needs of Samsung’s KC users, a <b>Feedback &amp; Support</b> page is included within the portal: Send feedback, view support documentation or submit a support ticket if you have any questions or encounter any issues.</p>
